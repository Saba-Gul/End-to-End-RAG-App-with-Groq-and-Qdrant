It must have, because Mariam remembered that she had been \\nrestless and preoccupied that day, the way she was only on Thursdays, the day when Jalil \\nvisited her at the  kolba . To pass the time until the moment that she would see him at last, \\ncrossing the knee -high grass in the clearing and waving, Mariam had climbed a chair and \\ntaken down h er mother\\'s Chinese tea set. The tea set was the sole relic that Mariam\\'s \\nmother, Nana, had of her own mother, who had died when Nana was two. Nana cherished \\neach blue -and-white  porcelain piece, the graceful curve of the pot\\'s spout, the hand -painted \\nfinch es and chrysanthemums, the dragon on the sugar bowl, meant to  ward off evil.  \\n \\n  It was this last piece that slipped from Mariam\\'s fingers, that fell to the wooden floor  \\nboards of the  kolba  and shattered.  \\n \\n  When Nana saw the bowl, her face flushed red and her upper lip shivered, and her eyes, \\nboth the lazy one and the good, settled on Mariam in a flat, unblinking way. Nana looked \\nso mad that Mariam feared  the jinn would enter her mother\\'s body again. But  the jinn didn\\'t \\ncome, not that time. Instead, Nana gr abbed Mariam by the wrists, pulled her close, and, \\nthrough gritted teeth, said, \"You are a clumsy little  harami  This is my reward for \\neverything I\\'ve endured An heirloom -breaking, clumsy little  harami.\"  \\n \\n  At the time, Mariam did not understand. She did no t know what this word  \\nharami --bastard --meant  Nor was she old enough to appreciate the injustice, to see that it is \\nthe creators of the  harami  who are culpable, not the  harami,  whose only sin is being born. \\nMariam  did surmise, by the way Nana said the word,  that it was an ugly, loathsome thing to \\nbe a harami,  like an insect, like the scurrying cockroaches Nana was always cursing and \\nsweeping out of the  kolba.  \\n \\n  Later, when she was older, Mariam did understand. It was the way Nana uttered the word \\nnot so muc h saying it as spitting it at her that made Mariam feel the full sting of it. She \\nunderstood then what Nana meant, that a  harami  was an unwanted thing; that she, Mariam, \\nwas an illegitimate person who would never have legitimate claim to the things other \\npeople had, things such as love, family, home, acceptance.  \\n \\n  Jalil never called Mariam this name. Jalil said she was his little flower. He was fond of \\nsitting her on his lap and telling her stories, like the time he told her that Herat, the city \\nwhere Mari am was bo rn, in 1959, had once been the cradle of Persian culture, the home of \\nwriters, painters, and Sufis.  \\n \\n  \"You couldn\\'t stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the ass,\" he laughed.  M '),\n",

He described to her the green wheat fields \\nof Herat, the orchards, the vines pregnant with plump grapes, the city\\'s crowded, vaulted \\nbazaars.  \\n \\n  \"There is a pistachio tree,\" Jali l said one day, \"and beneath it, Mariam jo, is buried none \\nother than the great poet Jami.\" He leaned in and whispered, \"Jami lived over five hundred \\nyears ago. He did. I took you there once, to the tree. You were little. You wouldn\\'t \\nremember.\"  \\n \\n  It was true. Mariam didn\\'t remember. And though she would live the first fifteen years of \\nher life within walking distance of Herat, Mariam would never see this storied tree. She \\nwould never see the famous minarets up close, and she would never pick fruit from He rat\\'s \\norchards or stroll in its fields of wheat. But whenever Jalil talked like this, Mariam would \\nlisten with enchantment. She would admire Jalil for his vast and worldly knowledge. She \\nwould quiver with pride to have a father who knew such things.  \\n \\n  \"What rich lies!\" Nana said after Jalil left. \"Rich man telling rich lies. He never took you \\nto any tree. And don\\'t let him charm you. He betrayed us, your beloved father. He cast us \\nout. He cast us out of his big fancy house like we were nothing to him. He d id it happily.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam would listen dutifully to this. She never dared say to Nana how much she disliked \\nher talking this way about Jalil. The truth was that around Jalil, Mariam did not feel at all \\nlike a  harami.  For an hour or two every Thursday, when  Jalil came to see her, all smiles \\nand gifts and endearments, Mariam felt deserving of all the beauty and bounty that life had \\nto give. And, for this, Mariam loved Jalil.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Even if she had to share him.  \\n  Jalil had three wives and nine children, ni ne legitimate children, all of whom were \\nstrangers to Mariam. He was one of Herat\\'s wealthiest men. He owned a cinema, which \\nMariam had never seen, but at her insistence Jalil had described it to her, and so she knew \\nthat the fa9ade was made of blue -and-tan terra -cotta tiles, that it had private balcony seats \\nand a trellised ceiling. Double swinging doors opened into a tiled lobby, where posters of \\nHindi films were encased in glass displays. On Tuesdays, Jalil said one day, kids got free \\nice cream at the co ncession stand  \\n  Nana smiled demurely when he said this. She waited until he had left the kolba , before \\nsnickering and saying, \"The children of strangers get ice cream. What do you get, Mariam? \\nStories of ice cream.\"  \\n \\n  In addition to the cinema, Jalil own ed land in Karokh, land in Farah, three carpet stores, a \\nclothing shop, and a black 1956 Buick Roadmaster. He was one of Herat\\'s best -connected \\nmen, friend of the mayor and the provincial governor. He had a cook, a driver, and three \\nhousekeepers.  \\n '),\n",

Until her belly began to swell.  \\n  When that happened, Nana said, the collective gasp of Jalil\\'s family sucked the air out of \\nHerat. His in laws swore blood would flow. The wives demanded that he throw her out. \\nNana\\'s own fa ther, who was a lowly stone carver in the nearby village of Gul Daman, \\ndisowned her. Disgraced, he packed his things and boarded a bus to Bran, never to be seen \\nor heard from again.  \\n \\n  \"Sometimes,\" Nana said early one morning, as she was feeding the chicke ns outside the \\nkolba , \"I wish my father had had the stomach to sharpen one of his knives and do the \\nhonorable thing. It might have been better for me.\" She tossed another handful of seeds into \\nthe coop, paused, and looked at Mariam. \"Better for you too, ma ybe. It would have spared \\nyou the grief of knowing that you are what you are. But he was a coward, my father. He \\ndidn\\'t have the  dil, the heart, for it.\"  \\n \\n  Jalil didn\\'t have the  dil either, Nana said, to do the honorable thing. To stand up to his \\nfamily, to his wives and in -laws, and accept responsibility for what he had done. Instead, \\nbehind closed doors, a face saving deal had quickly been struck. The next day, he had made \\nher gather her few things from the servants\\' quarters, where she\\'d been living, an d sent her \\noff. \\n  \"You know what he told his wives by way of defense? That I  forced  myself on him. That \\nit was my fault.  Didi? You see? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.\"  \\n \\n  Nana put down the bowl of chicken feed. She lifted Mariam\\'s chin with a finger.  \\n \\n  \"Look at me, Mariam.\"  \\n \\n  Reluctantly, Mariam did.  \\n \\n  Nana said, \"Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that \\npoints north, a man\\'s accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. You remember that, \\nMariam.\"  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

A mugwort. You too. And you weren\\'t even \\nborn yet.\"  \\n \\n  \"What\\'s a mugwort?\" Mariam asked  \\n \\n  \"A weed,\" Nana said. \"Something you rip out and toss aside.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam frowned internally. Jalil didn\\'t treat her as a w eed. He never had. But Mariam \\nthought it wise to suppress this protest.  \\n \\n  \"Unlike weeds, I had to be replanted, you see, given food and water. On account of you. \\nThat was the deal Jalil made with his family.\"  \\n \\n  Nana said she had refused to live in Herat.  \\n \\n  \"For what? To watch him drive his  kinchini  wives around town all day?\"  \\n \\n  She said she wouldn\\'t live in her father\\'s empty house either, in the village of Gul Daman, \\nwhich sat on a steep hill two kilometers north of Herat. She said she wanted to live \\nsomewhere removed, detached, where neighbors wouldn\\'t stare at her belly , point at her, \\nsnicker, or, worse yet, assault her with insincere kindnesses.  \\n \\n  \"And, believe me,\" Nana said, \"it was a relief to your father having me out of sight. It \\nsuited him jus t fine.\"  \\n  It was Muhsin, Jalil\\'s eldest son by his first wife, Khadija, who suggested the clearing . It \\nwas on the outskirts of Gul Daman. To get to it, one took a rutted, uphill dirt track that \\nbranched off the main road between Herat and Gul Daman. The t rack was flanked on either \\nside by knee high grass and speckles of white and bright yellow flowers. The track snaked \\nuphill and led to a flat field where poplars and cottonwoods soared and wild bushes grew in \\nclusters. From up there, one could make out the  tips of the rusted blades of Gul Daman\\'s \\nwindmill, on the left, and, on the right, all of Herat spread below. The path ended \\nperpendicular to a wide, trout -filled stream, which rolled down from the Safid -koh \\nmountains surrounding Gul Daman. Two hundred ya rds upstream, toward the mountains, \\nthere was a circular grove of weeping willow trees. In the center, in the shade of the \\nwillows, was the clearing.  \\n \\n  Jalil went there to have a look. When he came back, Nana said, he sounded like a warden \\nbragging about the clean walls and shiny floors of his prison.  \\n  \"And so, your father built us this rathole.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Nana had almost married once, when she was fifteen. The suitor had been a boy from \\nShindand, a young parakeet seller. Mariam knew the story from Nana h erself, and, though T '),\n",

Perhaps for the only time in her life, during those days leading up to her \\nwedding, Nana had been genuinely happy.  \\n \\n  As Nana told t he story, Mariam sat on her lap and pictured her mother being fitted for a \\nwedding dress. She imagined her on horseback, smiling shyly behind a veiled green gown, \\nher palms painted red with henna, her hair parted with silver dust, the braids held together \\nby tree sap. She saw musicians blowing the  shahnai  flute and banging on  dohol  drums, \\nstreet children hooting and giving chase.  \\n  Then, a week before the wedding date,  a jinn had entered Nana\\'s body. This required no \\ndescription to Mariam. She had witnessed  it enough times with her own eyes: Nana \\ncollapsing suddenly, her body tightening, becoming rigid, her eyes rolling back, her arms \\nand legs shaking as if something were throttling her from the inside, the froth at the corners \\nof her mouth, white, sometimes  pink with blood. Then the drowsiness, the frightening \\ndisorientation, the incoherent mumbling.  \\n  When the news reached Shindand, the parakeet seller\\'s family called off the wedding.  \\n \\n  \"They got spooked\" was how Nana put it.  \\n \\n  The wedding dress was stash ed away. After that, there were no more suitors.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  In the clearing, Jalil and two of his sons, Farhad and Muhsin, built the small  kolba  where \\nMariam would live the first fifteen years of her life. They raised it with sun dried bricks and \\nplastered it with mud and handfuls of straw. It had two sleeping cots, a wooden table, two \\nstraight backed chairs, a window, and shelves nailed to the walls where Nana placed clay \\npots and her beloved Chinese tea set. Jalil put in a new cast iron stove for the winte r and \\nstacked logs of chopped wood behind the kolba  He added a tandoor outside for making \\nbread and a chicken coop with a fence around it. He brought a few sheep, built them a \\nfeeding trough. He had Farhad and Muhsin dig a deep hole a hundred yards outside  the \\ncircle of willows and built an outhouse over it.  \\n  Jalil could have hired laborers to build the kolba . Nana said, but he didn\\'t.  \\n  \"His idea of penance.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  In Nana\\' s account of the day that she gave birth to Mariam, no one came to help. It \\nhappened on a damp, overcast day in the spring of 1959, she said, the twenty sixth year of \\nKing Zahir Shah\\'s mostly uneventful forty year reign. She said that Jalil hadn\\'t bothered to \\nsummon a doctor, or even a midwife, even though he knew that  the jinn might  enter her \\nbody and cause her to have one of her fits in the act of delivering. She lay all alone on the \\nkolba \\'s floor, a knife by her side, sweat drenching her body.  \\n \\n  \"When the pain got bad, I\\'d bite on a pillow and scream into it until I was hoarse. An d still \\nno one came to wipe my face or give me a drink of water. And you, Mariam jo, you were in '),\n",

Almost two days you made me lay on that cold, hard floor. I didn\\'t eat or sleep, all \\nI did was push and pray that you would come out.\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m sorry, Nana.\"  \\n \\n  \"I cut the cord between us myself. That\\'s why I had a knife.\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m sorry.\"  \\n \\n  Nana always gave a slow, burdened smile here, one of lingering recrimination or reluctant \\nforgiveness, Mariam could never tell It did not occur to young Mariam to po nder the \\nunfairness of apologizing for the manner of her own birth.  \\n  By the time it  did occur to her, around the time she turned ten, Mariam no longer believed \\nthis story of her birth. She believed Jali l’s version, that though he\\'d been away he\\'d \\narranged  for Nana to be taken to a hospital in Herat where she had been tended to by a \\ndoctor. She had lain on a clean, proper bed in a well lit room. Jalil shook his head with \\nsadness when Mariam told him about the knife.  \\n \\n  Mariam also came to doubt that she had  made her mother suffer for two full days.  \\n \\n  \"They told me it was all over within under an hour,\" Jalil said. \"You were a good daughter, \\nMariam jo. Even in birth you were a good daughter.\"  \\n \\n  \"He wasn\\'t even there!\" Nana spat. \"He was in Takht -e-Safar, ho rseback riding with his \\nprecious friends.\"  \\n \\n  When they informed him that he had a new daughter, Nana said, Jalil had shrugged, kept \\nbrushing his horse\\'s mane, and stayed in Takht -e-Safar another two weeks.  \\n \\n  \"The truth is, he didn\\'t even hold you until y ou were a month old. And then only to look \\ndown once, comment on your longish face, and hand you back to me.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam came to disbelieve this part of the story as well. Yes, Jalil admitted, he had been \\nhorseback riding in Takht -e-Safar, but, when they ga ve him the news, he had not shrugged. \\nHe had hopped on the saddle and ridden back to Herat. He had bounced her in his arms, run \\nhis thumb over her flaky eyebrows, and hummed a lullaby. Mariam did not picture Jalil \\nsaying that her face was long, though it w as true that it was long.  \\n \\n  Nana said she was the one who\\'d picked the name Mariam because it had been the name \\nof her mother. Jalil said he chose the name because Mariam, the tuberose, was a lovely \\nflower.  \\n \\n  \"Your favorite?\" Mariam asked.  \\n \\n  \"Well, one of,\" he said and smiled.  \\n '),\n",

The wheelbarrow came once a month, filled with rice, \\nflour, tea, sugar, cooking oil, soap, toothpaste. It was pushed by two of Mariam\\'s half \\nbrothers, usually Muhsin and Ramin, sometimes Ramin and Farhad. Up the dirt track, over \\nrocks and pebbles, around holes and bushes, the boys took turns pushing until they reached \\nthe stream. There, the wheelbarrow had to be emptied and the items hand carried across the \\nwater. Then the boys would transfer the wheelbarrow across the stream and load it up again. \\nAnother two hundred yards of pushing followed, this time through tall, dense grass and \\naround thickets of shrubs. Frogs leaped  out of their way. The brothers waved mosquitoes \\nfrom their sweaty faces.  \\n \\n  \"He has servants,\" Mariam said. \"He could send a servant.\"  \\n \\n  \"His idea of penance,\" Nana said.  \\n \\n  The sound of the wheelbarrow drew Mariam and Nana outside. Mariam would always \\nremember Nana the way she looked on Ration Day: a tall, bony, barefoot woman leaning in \\nthe doorway, her lazy eye narrowed to a slit, arms crossed in a defiant and mocking way. \\nHer short cropped, sunlit hair would be uncovered and uncombed. She would wear a n ill \\nfitting gray shirt buttoned to the throat. The pockets were filled with walnut sized rocks.  \\n \\n  The boys sat by the stream and waited as Mariam and Nana transferred the rations to the \\nkolba  They knew better than to get any closer than thirty yards, ev en though Nana\\'s aim \\nwas poor and most of the rocks landed well short of their targets. Nana yelled at the boys as \\nshe carried bags of rice inside, and called them names Mariam didn\\'t understand. She \\ncursed their mothers, made hateful faces at them. The bo ys never returned the insults.  \\n  Mariam felt sorry for the boys. How tired their arms and legs must be, she thought \\npityingly, pushing that heavy load. She wished she were allowed to offer them water. But \\nshe said nothing, and if they waved at her she didn \\'t wave back. Once, to please Nana, \\nMariam even yelled at Muhsin, told him he had a mouth shaped like a lizard\\'s ass and was \\nconsumed later with guilt, shame, and fear that they would tell Jalil. Nana, though, laughed \\nso hard, her rotting front tooth in fu ll display, that Mariam thought she would lapse into one \\nof her fits. She looked at Mariam when she was done and said, \"You\\'re a good daughter.\"  \\n  When the barrow was empty, the boys scuffled back and pushed it away. Mariam would \\nwait and watch them disapp ear into the tall grass and flowering weeds.  \\n \\n  \"Are you coming?\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes, Nana.\"  \\n \\n  \"They laugh at you. They do. I hear them.\"  \\n  \"I\\'m coming.\"  \\n \\n  \"You don\\'t believe me?\"  O '),\n",

Mariam and \\nNana milked the goats, fed the hens, and collected eggs. They made bread together. Nana \\nshowed her how to knead dough, how to kindle the tandoor and slap the flattened dough \\nonto its inner walls. Nana taught her to sew too, and to cook rice and all the different \\ntoppings:  shalqam  stew with turnip, spinach  sabzi,  cauliflower with ginger.  \\n \\n  Nana made  no secret of her dislike for visitors and, in fact, people in general but she made \\nexceptions for a select few. And so there was Gul Daman\\'s leader, the village  arbab,  Habib \\nKhan, a small headed, bearded man with a large belly who came by once a month or so, \\ntailed by a servant, who carried a chicken, sometimes a pot of  kichiri  rice, or a basket of \\ndyed eggs, for Mariam.  \\n \\n  Then there was a rotund, old woman that Nana called Bibi jo, whose late husband had \\nbeen a stone carver and friends with Nana\\'s father . Bibi jo was invariably accompanied by \\none of her six brides and a grandchild or two. She limped and huffed her way across the \\nclearing and made a great show of rubbing her hip and lowering herself, with a pained sigh, \\nonto the chair that Nana pulled up f or her. Bibi jo too always brought Mariam something, a \\nbox of  dishlemeh  candy, a basket of quinces. For Nana, she first brought complaints about \\nher failing health, and then gossip from Herat and Gul Daman, delivered at length and with \\ngusto, as her daught er-in-law sat  listening quietly and dutifully behind her.  \\n  But Mariam\\'s favorite, other than Jalil of course, was Mullah Faizullah, the elderly village \\nKoran tutor, its  akhund  He came by once or twice a week from Gul Daman to teach \\nMariam the five daily  namaz  prayers and tutor her in Koran recitation, just as he had taught \\nNana when she\\'d been a little girl It was Mullah Faizullah who had taught Mariam to read, \\nwho had patiently looked over her shoulder as her lips worked the words soundlessly, her \\nindex f inger lingering beneath each word, pressing until the nail bed went white, as though \\nshe could squeeze the meaning out of the symbols. It was Mullah Faizullah who had held \\nher hand, guided the pencil in it along the rise of each  alef, the curve of each  beh, the three \\ndots of each  seh. \\n \\n  He was a gaunt, stooping old man with a toothless smile and a white beard that dropped to \\nhis navel. Usually, he came alone to the kolba , though sometimes with his russet haired son \\nHamza, who was a few years older than Mar iam. When he showed up at the kolba , Mariam \\nkissed Mullah Faizullah\\'s hand -which felt like kissing a set of twigs covered with a thin \\nlayer of skin -and he kissed the top of her brow before they sat inside for the day\\'s lesson. \\nAfter, the two of them sat ou tside the kolba , ate pine nuts and sipped green tea, watched the \\nbulbul birds darting from tree to tree. Sometimes they went for walks among the bronze \\nfallen leaves and alder bushes, along the stream and toward the mountains. Mullah '),\n",

But he said he liked the enchanting  sounds the Arabic words made as \\nthey rolled off his tongue. He said they comforted him, eased his heart.  \\n  \"They\\'ll comfort you too, Mariam jo,\" he said. \"You can summon them in your time of \\nneed, and they won\\'t fail you. God\\'s words will never betray you , my girl\"  \\n  Mullah Faizullah listened to stories as well as he told them. When Mariam spoke, his \\nattention never wavered He nodded slowly and smiled with a look of gratitude, as if he had \\nbeen granted a coveted privilege. It was easy to tell Mullah Faizul lah things that Mariam \\ndidn\\'t dare tell Nana.  \\n \\n  One day, as they were walking, Mariam told him that she wished she would be allowed to \\ngo to school.  \\n \\n  \"I mean a real school,  akhund  sahib. Like in a classroom. Like my father\\'s other kids.\"  \\n \\n  Mullah Faizu llah stopped.  \\n  The week before, Bibi jo had brought news that Jalil\\'s daughters Saideh and Naheed were \\ngoing to the Mehri School for girls in Herat. Since then, thoughts of classrooms and \\nteachers had rattled around Mariam\\'s head, images of notebooks with  lined pages, columns \\nof numbers, and pens that made dark, heavy marks. She pictured herself in a classroom \\nwith other girls her age. Mariam longed to place a ruler on a page and draw important \\nlooking lines.  \\n  \"Is that what you want?\" Mullah Faizullah sai d, looking at her with his soft, watery eyes, \\nhis hands behind his stooping back, the shadow of his turban falling on a patch of bristling \\nbuttercups.  \\n \\n  \"Yes. \" \\n \\n  \"And you want me to ask your mother for permission.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam smiled. Other than Jalil, sh e thought there was no one in the world who \\nunderstood her better than her old tutor.  \\n \\n  \"Then what can I do? God, in His wisdom, has given us each weaknesses, and foremost \\namong my many is that I am powerless to refuse you, Mariam jo,\" he said, tapping he r \\ncheek with one arthritic finger.  \\n \\n  But later, when he broached Nana, she dropped the knife with which she was slicing \\nonions. \"What for?\"  \\n '),\n",

It\\'s like shining a spittoon. And you\\'ll learn \\nnothing of value in those schools. There is only one, only one skill a woman like you and \\nme needs in life, and they don\\'t teach it in school.

Endure.\"  \\n \\n  \"Endure what, Nana?\"  \\n \\n  \"Oh, don\\'t you fret about  that, \" Nana said. \"There won\\'t be any shortage of things.\"  \\n  She went on to say how Mil\\'s wives had called her an ugly, lowly stone carver\\'s daughter. \\nHow they\\'d made her wash laundry outside in the cold until her face went numb and her \\nfingertips burned.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s our lot in life, Mariam.

The village arbab  and his gifts, Bibi jo and \\nher aching hip and endless gossiping, and, of course, Mullah Faizullah. But there was \\nno one, no one, that Mariam longed to see more than Jalil.  \\n \\n  The anxiety set in on Tuesday nights. Mariam would sleep poorly, fretting that some \\nbusiness entanglement would prevent Jalil from coming on Thursday, that she would have \\nto wait a who le other week to see him. On Wednesdays, she paced outside, around the \\nkolba , tossed chicken feed absentmindedly into the coop. She went for aimless walks, \\npicking petals from flowers and batting at the mosquitoes nibbling on her arms. Finally, on \\nThursday s, all she could do was sit against a wall, eyes glued to the stream, and wait. If \\nJalil was running late, a terrible dread filled her bit by bit. Her knees would weaken, and \\nshe would have to go somewhere and lie down.  \\n \\n  Then Nana would call, \"And there he is, your father. In all his glory.\"  \\n  Mariam would leap to her feet when she spotted him hopping stones across the stream, all \\nsmiles and hearty waves. Mariam knew that Nana was watching her, gauging her reaction, \\nand it always took effort to stay in th e doorway, to wait, to watch him slowly make his way \\nto her, to not run to him. She restrained herself, patiently watched him walk through the tall \\ngrass, his suit jacket slung over his shoulder, the breeze lifting his red necktie.  \\n \\n  When Jalil entered th e clearing, he would throw his jacket on the tandoor and open his \\narms. Mariam would walk, then finally run, to him, and he would catch her under the arms \\nand toss her up high. Mariam would squeal.  \\n \\n  Suspended in the air, Mariam would see Jalil\\'s upturned  face below her, his wide, crooked \\nsmile, his widow\\'s peak, his cleft chin a perfect pocket for the tip of her pinkie his teeth, the \\nwhitest in a town of rotting molars. She liked his trimmed mustache, and she liked that no \\nmatter the weather he always wor e a suit on his visits dark brown, his favorite color, with \\nthe white triangle of a handkerchief in the breast pocket and cuff links too, and a tie, \\nusually red, which he left loosened Mariam could see herself too, reflected in the brown of \\nJalil\\'s eyes: h er hair billowing, her face blazing with excitement, the sky behind her.  \\n \\n  Nana said that one of these days he would miss, that she, Mariam, would slip through his \\nfingers, hit the ground, and break a bone. But Mariam did not believe that Jalil would drop  \\nher. She believed that she would always land safely into her father\\'s clean, well manicured \\nhands.  \\n \\n  They sat outside the kolba , in the shade, and Nana served them tea. Jalil and she \\nacknowledged each other with an uneasy smile and a nod. Jalil never bro ught up Nana\\'s \\nrock throwing or her cursing.  \\n \\n  Despite her rants against him when he wasn\\'t around, Nana was subdued and mannerly \\nwhen Jalil visited. Her hair was always washed. She brushed her teeth, wore her best  hijab  \\nfor him. She sat quietly on a chai r across from him, hands folded on her lap. She did not M '),\n",

When she laughed, she \\ncovered her mouth with a fist to hide the bad tooth.  \\n \\n  Nana asked about his businesses. And his wives too. When s he told him that she had \\nheard, through Bibi jo, that his youngest wife, Nargis, was expecting her third child, Jalil \\nsmiled courteously and nodded.  \\n \\n  \"Well. You must be happy,\" Nana said. \"How many is that for you, now? Ten, is it,  \\nmashallah ? Ten?\"  \\n \\n  Jalil said yes, ten.  \\n \\n  \"Eleven, if you count Mariam, of course.\"  \\n \\n  Later, after Jalil went home, Mariam and Nana had a small fight about this. Mariam said \\nshe had tricked him.  \\n \\n  After tea with Nana, Mariam and Jalil always went fishing in the stream. He s howed her \\nhow to cast her line, how to reel in the trout. He taught her the proper way to gut a trout, to \\nclean it, to lift the meat off the bone in one motion. He drew pictures for her as they waited \\nfor a strike, showed her how to draw an elephant in one  stroke without ever lifting the pen \\noff the paper. He taught her rhymes. Together they sang:  \\n \\n  Lili lili birdbath,  \\nSitting on a dirt path,  \\nMinnow sat on the rim and drank,  \\nSlipped, and in the water she sank . \\n \\n  Jalil brought clippings from Herat\\'s new spaper,  Iiiifaq -i Islam,  and read from them to her. \\nHe was Mariam\\'s link, her proof that there existed a world at large, beyond the kolba , \\nbeyond Gul Daman and Herat too, a world of presidents with unpronounceable names, and \\ntrains and museums and soccer, and rockets that orbited the earth and landed on the moon, \\nand, every Thursday, Jalil brought a piece of that world with him to the kolba . \\n \\n  He was the one who told her in the summer of 1973, when Mariam was fourteen, that \\nKing Zahir Shah, who had ruled f rom Kabul for forty years, had been overthrown in a \\nbloodless coup.  \\n \\n  \"His cousin Daoud Khan did it while the king was in Italy getting medical treatment  \\nYou remember Daoud Khan, right? I told you about him. He was prime minister in Kabul \\nwhen you were b om. Anyway, Afghanistan is no longer a monarchy, Mariam. You see, it\\'s \\na republic now, and Daoud Khan is the president. There are rumors that the socialists in \\nKabul helped him take power. Not that he\\'s a socialist himself, mind you, but that they \\nhelped h im. That\\'s the rumor anyway.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam asked him what a socialist was and Jalil began  to explain,  but Mariam barely '),\n",

Of course. Well. Here, the n. \\nWithout further ado…\"  \\n \\n  He fished a small box from his pocket and gave it to her. He did this from time to time, \\nbring her small presents. A carnelian bracelet cuff one time, a choker with lapis lazuli beads \\nanother. That day, Mariam opened the box and  found a leaf shaped pendant, tiny coins \\netched with moons and stars hanging from it.  \\n \\n  \"Try it on, Mariam jo.\"  \\n \\n  She did. \"What do you think?\"  \\n \\n  Jalil beamed \"I think you look like a queen.\"  \\n \\n  After he left, Nana saw the pendant around Mariam\\'s neck.  \\n  \"Nomad jewelry,\" she said. \"I\\'ve seen them make it. They melt the coins people throw at \\nthem and make jewelry. Let\\'s see him bring you gold next time, your precious father. Let\\'s \\nsee him.\"  \\n \\n  When it was time for Jalil to leave, Mariam always stood in th e doorway and watched him \\nexit the clearing, deflated at the thought of the week that stood, like an immense, \\nimmovable object, between her and his next visit. Mariam always held her breath as she \\nwatched him go. She held her breath and, in her head, count ed seconds. She pretended that \\nfor each second that she didn\\'t breathe, God would grant her another day with Jalil.  \\n \\n  At night, Mariam lay in her cot and wondered what his house in Herat was like. She \\nwondered what it would be like to live with him, to se e him every day. She pictured herself \\nhanding him a towel as he shaved, telling him when he nicked himself. She would brew tea \\nfor him. She would sew on his missing buttons. They would take walks in Herat together, \\nin the vaulted bazaar where Jalil said yo u could find anything you wanted. They would ride \\nin his car, and people would point and say, \"There goes Jalil Khan with his daughter.\" He \\nwould show her the famed tree that had a poet buried beneath it.  \\n \\n  One day soon, Mariam decided, she would tell Jal il these things. And when he heard, \\nwhen he saw how much she missed him when he was gone, he would surely take her with \\nhim. He would bring her to Herat, to live in his house, just like his other children.  \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

The three of them were sitting \\noutside the kolba , in a patch of shade thrown by the willows, on folding chairs arranged in a \\ntriangle.  \\n \\n  \"For my birthday…1 know what I want.\"  \\n \\n  \"You do?\" said Ja lil, smiling encouragingly.  \\n \\n  Two weeks before, at Mariam\\'s prodding, Jalil had let on that an American film was \\nplaying at his cinema. It was  a special kind of film, what he\\'d called a cartoon. The entire \\nfilm was a series of drawings, he said, thousands  of them, so that when they were made into \\na film and projected onto a screen you had the illusion that the drawings were moving. Jalil \\nsaid the film told the story of an old, childless toymaker who is lonely and desperately \\nwants a son. So he carves a pup pet, a boy, who magically comes to life. Mariam had asked \\nhim to tell her more, and Jalil said  that the old man and his puppet had all sorts of \\nadventures, that there was a place called Pleasure Island, and bad boys who turned into \\ndonkeys. They even got s wallowed by a whale at the end, the puppet and his father. \\nMariam had told Mullah Faizullah all about this film.  \\n \\n  \"I want you to take me to your cinema,\" Mariam said now. \"I want to see the cartoon. I \\nwant to see the puppet boy.\"  \\n \\n  With this, Mariam sen sed a shift in the atmosphere. Her parents stirred in their seats. \\nMariam could feel them exchanging looks.  \\n \\n  \"That\\'s not a good idea,\" said Nana. Her voice was calm, had the controlled, polite tone \\nshe used around Jalil, but Mariam could feel her hard, a ccusing glare.  \\n  Jalil shifted on his chair. He coughed, cleared his throat.  \\n \\n  \"You know,\" he said, \"the picture quality isn\\'t that good. Neither is the sound. And the \\nprojector\\'s been malfunctioning recently. Maybe your mother is right. Maybe you can thi nk \\nof another present, Mariam jo.\"  \\n \\n  \"Aneh  ,\"Nana said. \"You see?

I want to meet them. I want us all to \\ngo, together. It\\'s what I want.\"  \\n \\n  Jalil sighed. He was looking away, toward the mountains.  \\n  Mariam remembered him telling her that on the screen a human face looked as big as a \\nhouse, that when a car crashed up there you felt the metal twisting in your bones. She \\npictured herself sitting in the private balcony seats,  lapping at ice cream, alongside her \\nsiblings and Jalil. \"It\\'s what I want,\" she said.  \\n \\n  Jalil looked at her with a forlorn expression.  \\n \\n  \"Tomorrow. At noon. I\\'ll meet you at this very spot. All right? Tomorrow?\"  \\n  \"Come here,\" he said. He hunkered down,  pulled her to him, and held her for a long, long \\ntime.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  At first.

If she could articulate it, she \\nmight have said  to Nana that she was tired of being an instrument, of being lied to, laid \\nclaim to, used.

Herat was visible from here, spread below her like a child's board \\ngame: the Women's Garden to the north of the city, Char -suq Bazaar and the ruins of \\nAlexander the Great's old citadel to the south. She c ould make out the minarets in the \\ndistance, like the dusty fingers of giants, and the streets that she imagined were milling with \\npeople, carts, mules. She saw swallows swooping and circling overhead. She was envious \\nof these birds. They had been to Herat.  They had flown over its mosques, its bazaars. \\nMaybe they had landed on the walls of Jalil's home, on the front steps of his cinema.  \\n \\n  She picked up ten pebbles and arranged them vertically, in three columns. This was a \\ngame that she played privately from  time to time when Nana wasn't looking. She put four \\npebbles in the first column, for Khadija's children, three for Afsoon's, and three in the third \\ncolumn for Nargis's children. Then she added a fourth column. A solitary, eleventh pebble.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The ne xt morning, Mariam wore a cream -colored dress that fell to her knees, cotton \\ntrousers, and a green  hijab  over her hair. She agonized a bit over the  hijab,  its being green \\nand not matching the dress, but it would have to do --moths had eaten holes into her w hite \\none. \\n \\n  She checked the clock. It was an old hand wound clock with black numbers on a mint \\ngreen face, a present from Mullah Faizullah. It was nine o'clock. She wondered where Nana \\nwas. She thought about going outside and looking for her, but she drea ded the \\nconfrontation, the aggrieved looks. Nana would accuse her of betrayal. She would mock her \\nfor her mistaken ambitions.  \\n \\n  Mariam sat down. She tried to make time pass by drawing an elephant in one stroke, the \\nway Jalil had shown her, over and over. She became stiff from all the sitting but wouldn't \\nlie down for fear that her dress would wrinkle.  \\n \\n  When the hands finally showed eleven thirty, Mariam pocketed the eleven pebbles and \\nwent outside. On her way to the stream, she saw Nana sitting on a chai r, in the shade, \\nbeneath the domed roof of a weeping willow. Mariam couldn't tell whether Nana saw her or \\nnot. \"),\n",

In the sky, a \\nfew gray, cauliflower shaped clouds drifted by.

Barefoot boys gave chase to cars and buses, \\nwaving bags of quinces. Mariam stood at a street corner and watched the passersby, unable \\nto understand how they could be so indifferent to the marvels around them.  \\n \\n  After a while, she worked up the nerve to ask the elderly owner of a horse drawn gari if he \\nknew where Jalil, the cinema\\'s owner, lived.

He brought his horse to a stop at the \\nmidway point.  \\n \\n  \"There. Looks like you\\'re in luck,  dokhiarjo.  That\\'s his car.\"  \\n  Mariam hopped down. He smiled and rode on.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mariam had never before touched a c ar. She ran her fingers along the hood of Jalil\\'s car, \\nwhich was black, shiny, with glittering wheels in which Mariam saw a flattened, widened \\nversion of herself. The seats were made of white leather. Behind the steering wheel, \\nMariam saw round glass panel s with needles behind them.  \\n \\n  For a moment, Mariam heard Nana\\'s voice in her head, mocking, dousing the deep seated \\nglow of her hopes. With shaky legs, Mariam approached the front door of the house. She \\nput her hands on the walls. They were so tall, so fo reboding, Jalil\\'s walls.

There was a faint \\nsmile on her lips now, and an air of eagerness about her, of anticipation. \"Wait here,\" the \\ngirl said quickly.  \\n  She closed the door.  \\n  A few minutes passed.

She spent the \\nnight outside Jalil\\'s house. She watched the sky darken, the shadows engu lf the neighboring \\nhousefronts. The tattooed girl brought her some bread and a plate of rice, which Mariam \\nsaid she didn\\'t want. The girl left it near Mariam. From time to time, Mariam heard \\nfootsteps down the street, doors swinging open, muffled greetings . Electric lights came on, \\nand windows glowed dimly. Dogs barked. When she could no longer resist the hunger, \\nMariam ate the plate of rice and the bread. Then she listened to the crickets chirping from \\ngardens. Overhead, clouds slid past a pale moon.  \\n \\n  In the morning, she was shaken awake. Mariam saw that during the night someone had \\ncovered her with a blanket.  \\n \\n  It was the driver shaking her shoulder.  \\n \\n  \"This is enough. You\\'ve made a scene.  Bas. It\\'s time to go.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam sat up and rubbed her eyes. He r back and neck were sore. \"I\\'m going to wait for \\nhim.\"  \\n \\n  \"Look at me,\" he said. \"Jalil Khan says that I need to take you back now. Right now. Do \\nyou understand? Jalil Khan says so.\"  \\n \\n  He opened the rear passenger door to the car. \"Bia Come on,\" he said s oftly.  \\n \\n  \"I want to see him,\" Mariam said. Her eyes were tearing over.  \\n \\n  The driver sighed. \"Let me take you home. Come on,  dokhtarjo.  \" \\n \\n  Mariam stood up and walked toward him. But then, at the last moment, she changed \\ndirection and ran to the front ga tes. She felt the driver\\'s fingers fumbling for a grip at her \\nshoulder. She shed him and burst through the open gates.  \\n \\n  In the handful of seconds that she was in Jalil\\'s garden, Mariam\\'s eyes registered seeing a \\ngleaming glass structure with plants insid e it, grape vines clinging to wooden trellises, a \\nfishpond built with gray blocks of stone, fruit  \\n  trees, and bushes of brightly colored flowers everywhere. Her gaze skimmed over all of \\nthese things before they found a face, across the garden, in an upsta irs window. The face \\nwas there for only an instant, a flash, but long enough. Long enough for Mariam to see the \\neyes widen, the mouth open. Then it snapped away from view. A hand appeared and \\nfrantically pulled at a cord. The curtains fell shut.  \\n  Then a p air of hands buried into her armpits and she was lifted off the ground. Mariam \\nkicked. The pebbles spilled from her pocket. Mariam kept kicking and crying as she was \\ncarried to the car and lowered onto the cold leather of the backseat.  \\n '),\n",

Mariam did not hear him. All \\nduring the ride, as she bounced in the backseat, she cried. They were tears of grief, of anger, \\nof disillusionment. But mainly tears of a deep, deep shame at how foolishly she had  given \\nherself over to Jalil, how she had fretted over what dress to wear, over the mismatching  \\nhijab,  walking all the way here, refusing to leave, sleeping on the street like a stray dog. \\nAnd \\n \\n  she was ashamed of how she had dismissed her mother\\'s strick en looks, her puffy eyes. \\nNana, who had warned her, who had been right all along.  \\n \\n  Mariam kept thinking of his face in the upstairs window. He let her sleep on the street.  On \\nthe street  Mariam cried lying down. She didn\\'t sit up, didn\\'t want to be seen. She imagined \\nall of Herat knew this morning how she\\'d disgraced herself. She wished Mullah Faizullah \\nwere here so she could put her head on his lap and let him comfort her.  \\n \\n  After a while, the road became bumpier and the nose of the car pointed up. They were on \\nthe uphill road between Herat and Gul Daman.  \\n \\n  What would she say to Nana, Mariam wondered. How would she apologize? How could \\nshe even face Nana now?  \\n \\n  The car stopped and the driver helped her out. \"I\\'ll walk you,\" he said.  \\n \\n  She let him guide  her across the road and up the track. There was honeysuckle growing \\nalong the path, and milkweed too. Bees were buzzing over twinkling wildflowers. The \\ndriver took her hand and helped her cross the stream. Then he let go, and he was talking \\nabout how Hera t\\'s famous one hundred and twenty days\\' winds would start blowing soon, \\nfrom midmorning to dusk, and how the sand flies would go on a feeding frenzy, and then \\nsuddenly he was standing in front of her, trying to cover her eyes, pushing her back the way \\nthey had come and saying, \"Go back! No. Don\\'t look now. Turn around! Go back!\"  \\n \\n  But he wasn\\'t fast enough. Mariam saw. A gust of wind blew and parted the drooping \\nbranches of the weeping willow like a curtain, and Mariam caught a glimpse of what was \\nbeneath the tree: the straight backed chair, overturned. The rope dropping from a high \\nbranch. Nana dangling at the end of it.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

He collected a few of her thin gs, put them in a suitcase. He sat beside her cot, \\nwhere she lay down, and fanned her face. He stroked her forehead, and, with a woebegone \\nexpression on his face, asked if she needed  anything? anything?    he said it like that, \\ntwice.  \\n \\n  \"I want Mullah Faiz ullah,\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n  \"Of course. He\\'s outside. I\\'ll get him for you.\"  \\n \\n  It was when Mullah Faizullah\\'s slight, stooping figure appeared in the kolba \\'s doorway \\nthat Mariam cried for the first time that day.  \\n \\n  \"Oh, Mariam jo.\"  \\n \\n  He sat next to her and cupped her face in his hands. \"You go on and cry, Mariam jo. Go \\non. There is no shame in it. But remember, my girl, what the Koran says, \\'Blessed is He in \\nWhose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over all things, Who created death and \\nlife that He m ay try you.\\' The Koran speaks the truth, my girl.  \\n \\n  Behind every trial and every sorrow that He makes us shoulder, God has a reason.\"  \\n  But Mariam could not hear comfort in God\\'s words. Not that day. Not then. All she could \\nhear was Nana saying,  I\\'ll die if you go. I\\'ll just die.  All she could do was cry and cry and \\nlet her tears fall on the spotted, paper thin skin of Mullah Faizullah\\'s hands.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  On the ride to his house, Jalil sat in the backseat of his car with Mariam, his arm draped \\nover her sho ulder.  \\n \\n  \"You can stay with me, Mariam jo,\" he said. \"I\\'ve asked them already to clean a room for \\nyou. It\\'s upstairs. You\\'ll like it, I think. You\\'ll have a view of the garden.\"  \\n  For the first time, Mariam could hear him with Nana\\'s ears.

She could not \\nbring herself to look at him.  \\n \\n  When the car stopped before Jalil\\'s house, the driver opened the door for them and carried \\nMariam\\'s suitcase.

She kept her gaze to the \\nground, on her feet, stepping on the gray stone path. She was aware of the presence of \\npeople in the garden, murmuring, stepping aside, as she and Jalil walked past. She sensed \\nthe weight of eyes on her, looking down from the windows upstairs.  \\n \\n  Inside the house too, Mariam kept her head down. She walked on a maroon carpet with a \\nrepeating blue and y ellow octagonal pattern, saw out of the corner of her eye the marble \\nbases of statues, the lower halves of vases, the frayed ends of richly colored tapestries \\nhanging from walls. The stairs she and Jalil took were wide and covered with a  similar \\ncarpet, na iled down at the base of each step. At the top of the stairs, Jalil led her to the left, \\ndown another long, carpeted hallway. He stopped by one of the doors, opened it, and let her \\nin. \\n \\n  \"Your sisters Niloufar and Atieh play here sometimes,\" Jalil said, \" but mostly we use this \\nas a guest room. You\\'ll be comfortable here, I think. It\\'s nice, isn\\'t it?\"  \\n  The room had a bed with a green flowered blanket knit in a tightly woven, honeycomb \\ndesign. The curtains, pulled back to reveal the garden below, matched t he blanket. Beside \\nthe bed was a three drawer chest with a flower vase on it. There were shelves along the \\nwalls, with framed pictures of people Mariam did not recognize. On one of the shelves, \\nMariam saw a collection of identical wooden dolls, arranged in  a line in order of decreasing \\nsize. \\n \\n  Jalil saw her looking. \"Matryoshka  dolls. I got them in Moscow. You can play with them, \\nif you want. No one will mind.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam sat down on the bed.  \\n \\n  \"Is there anything you want?\" Jalil said.  \\n \\n  Mariam lay down. C losed her eyes. After a while, she heard him softly shut the door.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Except for \"when she had to use the bathroom down the hall, Mariam stayed in the room. \\nThe girl with the tattoo, the one who had opened the gates to her, brought her meals on a \\ntray: lamb kebab,  sabzi, aush  soup. Most of it went uneaten. Jalil came by several times a \\nday, sat on the bed beside her, asked her if she was all right.  \\n \\n  \"You could eat downstairs with the rest of us,\" he said, but without much conviction. He \\nunderstood a little too readily when Mariam said she preferred to eat alone.  \\n \\n  From the window, Mariam watched impassively what she had wondered about and longed \\nto see for most of her life: the comings and goings of Jalil\\'s daily life. Servants rushed in \\nand out of  the front gates. A gardener was always trimming bushes, watering plants in the \\ngreenhouse. Cars with long, sleek hoods pulled up on the street. From them emerged men \\nin suits, in  chapcms  and caracul hats, women in  hijabs,  children with neatly combed hair.  '),\n",

She did not \\nbelong here.  \\n \\n  But where do I belong? What am I going to do now?  \\n  I\\'m all you have in this world, Mariam, and when I\\'m gone you\\'ll have nothing. You\\'ll \\nhave nothing. You  are nothing!  \\n  Like the wind through the willows around the kolba , gusts of an inexpressible blackness \\nkept passing through Mariam.  \\n \\n  On Mariam\\'s second full d ay at Jalil\\'s house, a little girl came into the room.  \\n  \"I have to get something,\" she said.  \\n \\n  Mariam sat up on the bed and crossed her legs, pulled the blanket on her lap.  \\n  The girl hurried across the room and opened the closet door. She fetched a squa re shaped \\ngray box.  \\n \\n  \"You know what this is?\" she said. She opened the box. \"It\\'s called a gramophone.  Gramo. \\nPhone.  It plays records. You know, music. A gramophone.\"  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re Niloufar. You\\'re eight.\"  \\n \\n  The little girl smiled. She had Jalil\\'s smile an d his dimpled chin. \"How did you know?\"  \\n \\n  Mariam shrugged. She didn\\'t say to this girl that she\\'d once named a pebble after her.  \\n \\n  \"Do you want to hear a song?\"  \\n \\n  Mariam shrugged again.  \\n  Niloufar plugged in the gramophone. She fished a small record fro m a pouch beneath the \\nbox\\'s lid. She put it on, lowered the needle. Music began to play.  \\n \\n  1 will use a flower petal for paper, And write you the sweetest letter, You are the sultan of \\nmy heart, the sultan of my heart  \\n \\n  \"Do you know it?\"  \\n \\n  \"No.\"  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s from an Iranian film.

She lay in bed looking at the sky, \\nlistening to the footsteps below, the voices muffled by walls and the sheets of rain \\npunishing the window. When she did doze off, she was startled awake by shouting. Voices \\ndownstairs,  sharp and angry. Mariam couldn\\'t make out the words. Someone slammed a \\ndoor.  \\n \\n  The next morning, Mullah Faizullah came to visit her. When she saw her friend at the \\ndoor, his white beard and his amiable, toothless smile, Mariam felt tears stinging the \\ncorners of her eyes again. She swung her feet over the side of the bed and hurried over. She \\nkissed his hand as always and he her brow. She pulled him up a chair He showed her the \\nKoran he had brought with him and opened it. \"I figured no sense in skipping ou r routine, \\neh?\" \\n \\n  \"You know I don\\'t need lessons anymore, Mullah sahib.

Between them, \\nin the center of the table, was a crystal vase of fres h marigolds and a sweating pitcher \\nof water. The red haired woman who had introduced herself as Niloufar\\'s mother, Afsoon, \\nwas sitting on Jalil\\'s right. The other two, Khadija and Nargis, were on his left. The wives \\neach had on a flimsy black scarf, which they wore not on their heads but tied loosely \\naround the neck like an afterthought. Mariam, who could not imagine that they would wear \\nblack for Nana, pictured one of them suggesting it, or maybe Jalil, just before she\\'d been \\nsummoned.  \\n \\n  Afsoon poured wat er from the pitcher and put the glass before Mariam on a checkered \\ncloth coaster. \"Only spring and it\\'s warm already,\" she said. She made a fanning motion \\nwith her hand.  \\n \\n  \"Have you been comfortable?\" Nargis, who had a small chin and curly black hair, ask ed. \\n\"We hope you\\'ve been comfortable. This… ordeal…must be very hard for you. So \\ndifficult.\"  \\n \\n  The other two nodded. Mariam took in their plucked eyebrows, the thin, tolerant smiles \\nthey were giving her. There was an unpleasant hum in Mariam\\'s head. Her t hroat burned. \\nShe drank some of the water.  \\n \\n  Through the wide window behind Jalil, Mariam could see a row of flowering apple trees. \\nOn the wall beside the window stood a dark wooden cabinet. In it was a clock, and a \\nframed photograph of Jalil and three yo ung boys holding a fish. The sun caught the sparkle \\nin the fish\\'s scales. Jalil and the boys were grinning.  \\n \\n  \"Well,\" Afsoon began. \"I --that is, we --have brought you here because we have some very \\ngood news to give you.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam looked up.  \\n  She caught a quick exchange of glances between the women over Jalil, who slouched in \\nhis chair looking unseeingly at the pitcher on the table. It was Khadija, the oldest looking of \\nthe three, who turned her gaze to Mariam, and Mariam had the impression that this duty  too \\nhad been discussed, agreed upon, before they had called for her.  \\n \\n  \"You have a suitor,\" Khadija said.  \\n \\n  Mariam\\'s stomach fell. \"A what?\" she said through suddenly numb lips.  \\n \\n  \"A khasiegar.

The room was reeling up and down, the ground shifting \\nbeneath her feet.  \\n \\n  \"He\\'s a shoemaker,\" Khadija was saying now. \"But not some kind of ordinary street -side \\nmoochi,  no, no. He has his own shop, and he is one of the most sought after shoemakers in \\nKabul He makes them for diplomats, members of the presidential family that class of \\npeople.

What \\nshe\\'s saying, is it true?\"  \\n \\n  But Jalil wouldn\\'t look at her. He went on chewing the corner of his lower lip and staring \\nat the pitcher.  \\n \\n  \"Now he  is a little older than you,\" Afsoon chimed in. \"But he can\\'t be m ore than…forty. \\nForty five at the most. Wouldn\\'t you say,  Nargis?\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes. But I\\'ve seen nine year old girls given to men twenty years older than your suitor, \\nMariam. We all have. What are you, fifteen? That\\'s a good, solid marrying age for a girl.\" \\nThere  was enthusiastic nodding at this. It did not escape Mariam that no mention was made \\nof her half sisters Saideh or Naheed, both her own age, both students in the Mehri School in \\nHerat, both with plans to enroll in Kabul University. Fifteen, evidently, was not a good, \\nsolid marrying age for them.  \\n \\n  \"What\\'s more,\" Nargis went on, \"he too has had a great loss in his life.

She went on staring at Jalil, \\nwaiting for him to speak up, to say that none of this was true.  \\n \\n  \"You can\\'t spend the rest of your life here.\"  \\n \\n  \"Don\\'t you want a family of your own?\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes.

She was being sent away because \\nshe was the walking, breathing embodiment of their shame.  \\n  \"He\\'s  so old and weak,\" Khadija eventually said. \"And what will you do when he\\'s gone? \\nYou\\'d be a burden to his family.\"  \\n \\n  As you are now to us . Mariam almost  saw the unspoken words exit Khadija\\'s mouth, like \\nfoggy breath on a cold day.  \\n \\n  Mariam pictured hers elf in Kabul, a big, strange, crowded city that, Jalil had once told her, \\nwas some six hundred and fifty kilometers to the east of Herat.  Six hundred and fifty \\nkilometers.  The farthest she\\'d ever been from the kolba  was the two kilometer walk she\\'d \\nmade to  Jalil\\'s house. She pictured herself living there, in Kabul, at the other end of that \\nunimaginable distance, living in a stranger\\'s house where she would have to concede to his \\nmoods and his issued demands. She would have to clean after this man, Rasheed, cook for \\nhim, wash his clothes. And there would be other chores as well Nana had told her what \\nhusbands did to their wives. It was the thought of these intimacies in particular, which she \\nimagined as painful acts of perversity, that filled her with dread a nd made her break out in a \\nsweat.  \\n \\n  She turned to Jalil again. \"Tell them. Tell them you won\\'t let them do this.\"  \\n  \"Actually, your father has already given Rasheed his answer,\" Afsoon said. \"Rasheed is \\nhere, in Herat; he has come all the way from Kabul. The nikka  will be tomorrow morning, \\nand then there is a bus leaving for Kabul at noon.\"  \\n \\n  \"Tell them!\" Mariam cried  \\n \\n  The women grew quiet now. Mariam sensed that they were watching him too. Waiting. A \\nsilence fell over the room. Jalil kept twirling his wedding band, with a bruised, helpless \\nlook on his face. From inside the cabinet, the clock ticked on and on.  \\n \\n  \"Jalil jo?\" one of the women said at last.  \\n \\n  Mil\\'s eyes lifted slowly, met Mariam\\'s, lingered for a moment, then dropped. He opened '),\n",

Her eyes traced the sleek shape of the table\\'s legs, the sinuous curves of \\nits corners, the gleam of its reflective, dark brown surface. She noticed that every time she \\nbreathed out, the surface fogged, and she disappeared from her father\\'s table.  \\n \\n  Afsoon escorted her back to the room upstairs. When Afsoon closed the door, Mariam \\nheard the rattling o f a key as it turned in the lock.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

Afsoon gave her a green  hijab  and a pair of matching sandals.  \\n \\n  She was taken to the room with the long, brown ta ble, except now there was a bowl of \\nsugar coated almond candy in the middle of the table, a Koran, a green veil, and a mirror. \\nTwo men Mariam had never seen before  witnesses, she presumed and a mullah she did \\nnot recognize were already seated at the table . \\n \\n  Jalil showed her to a chair. He was wearing a light brown suit and a red tie. His hair was \\nwashed. When he pulled out the chair for her, he tried to smile encouragingly. Khadija and \\nAfsoon sat on Mariam\\'s side of the table this time.  \\n \\n  The mullah mot ioned toward the veil, and Nargis arranged it on Mariam\\'s head before \\ntaking a seat. Mariam looked down at her hands.  \\n \\n  \"You can call him in now,\" Jalil said to someone.  \\n \\n  Mariam smelled him before she saw him. Cigarette smoke and thick, sweet cologne, n ot \\nfaint like Jalil\\'s. The scent of it flooded Mariam\\'s nostrils. Through the veil, from the corner \\nof her eye, Mariam saw a tall man, thick bellied and broad shouldered, stooping in the \\ndoorway. The size of him almost made her gasp, and she had to drop he r gaze, her heart \\nhammering away. She sensed him lingering in the doorway. Then his slow, heavy footed \\nmovement across the room. The candy bowl on the table clinked in tune with his steps. \\nWith a thick grunt, he dropped on a chair beside her. He breathed n oisily.  \\n  The mullah welcomed them. He said this would not be a traditional  nikka . \\n \\n  \"I understand that Rasheed  agha  has tickets for the bus to Kabul that leaves shortly. So, in \\nthe interest of time, we will bypass some of the traditional steps to speed u p the \\nproceedings.\"  \\n \\n  The mullah gave a few blessings, said a few words about the importance of marriage. He \\nasked Jalil if he had any objections to this union, and Jalil shook his head. Then the mullah \\nasked Rasheed if he indeed wished to enter into a ma rriage contract with Mariam. Rasheed \\nsaid, \"Yes.\" His harsh, raspy voice reminded Mariam of the sound of dry autumn leaves \\ncrushed underfoot.  \\n \\n  \"And do you, Mariam jan, accept this man as your husband?\"  \\n \\n  Mariam stayed quiet. Throats were cleared.  \\n \\n  \"She does,\" a female voice said from down the table.  \\n \\n  \"Actually,\" the mullah said, \"she herself has to answer. And she should wait until I ask \\nthree times. The point is, he\\'s seeking her, not the other way around.\"  I '),\n",

W hen Mariam didn\\'t answer, he asked it once \\nmore, this time more  \\n \\n  forcefully  Mariam could feel Jalil beside her shifting on his seat, could sense feet \\ncrossing and uncrossing beneath the table. There was more throat clearing. A small, white \\nhand reached out and flicked a bit of dust off the table.  \\n \\n  \"Mariam,\" Jalil whispered.  \\n \\n  \"Yes,\" she said shakily.  \\n \\n  A mirror was passed beneath the veil. In it, Mariam saw her own face first, the archless, \\nunshapely eyebrows, the flat hair, the eyes, mirthless green  and set so closely together that \\none might mistake her for being cross eyed. Her skin was coarse and had a dull, spotty \\nappearance. She thought her brow too wide, the chin too narrow, the lips too thin. The \\noverall impression was of a long face, a triangu lar face, a bit houndlike. And yet Mariam \\nsaw that, oddly enough, the whole of these unmemorable parts made for a face that was not \\npretty but, somehow, not unpleasant to look at either.  \\n \\n  In the mirror, Mariam had her first glimpse of Rasheed: the big, s quare, ruddy face; the \\nhooked nose; the flushed cheeks that gave the impression of sly cheerfulness; the watery, \\nbloodshot eyes; the crowded teeth, the front two pushed together like a gabled roof; the \\nimpossibly low hairline, barely two finger widths abov e the bushy eyebrows; the wall of \\nthick, coarse, salt and pepper hair.  \\n \\n  Their gazes met briefly in the glass and slid away.  \\n \\n  This is the face of my husband,  Mariam thought.  \\n \\n  They exchanged the thin gold bands that Rasheed fished from his coat pocket.  His nails \\nwere yellow brown, like the inside of a rotting apple, and some of the tips were curling, \\nlifting. Mariam\\'s hands shook when she tried to slip the band onto his finger, and Rasheed \\nhad to help her. Her own band was a little tight, but Rasheed ha d no trouble forcing it over \\nher knuckles.  \\n \\n  \"There,\" he said.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s a pretty ring,\" one of the wives said. \"It\\'s lovely, Mariam.\"  \\n \\n  \"All that remains now is the signing of the contract,\" the mullah said.  \\n \\n  Mariam signed her name -the meem,  the reh, the the ya and the  meem  again -conscious of \\nall the eyes on her hand. The next time Mariam signed her name to a document, twenty \\nseven years later, a mullah would again be present.  \\n '),\n",

Congratulations. \" \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Rasheed waited in the multicolored bus. Mariam could not see him from where she stood \\nwith Jalil, by the rear bumper, only the smoke of his cigarette curling up from the open \\nwindow. Around them, hands shook and farewells were said. Korans were  kissed, passed \\nunder. Barefoot boys bounced between travelers, their faces invisible behind their trays of \\nchewing gum and cigarettes.  \\n \\n  Jalil was busy telling her that Kabul was so beautiful, the Moghul emperor Babur had \\nasked that he be buried there. N ext, Mariam knew, he\\'d go on about Kabul\\'s gardens, and \\nits shops, its trees, and its air, and, before long, she would be on the bus and he would walk \\nalongside it, waving cheerfully, unscathed, spared.  \\n  Mariam could not bring herself to allow it.  \\n \\n  \"I used to worship you,\" she said.  \\n \\n  Jalil stopped in midsentence. He crossed and uncrossed his arms. A young Hindi couple, \\nthe wife cradling a boy, the husband dragging a suitcase, passed between them. Jalil \\nseemed grateful for the interruption. They excused  themselves, and he smiled back politely.  \\n \\n  \"On Thursdays, I sat for hours waiting for you. I worried myself sick that you wouldn\\'t \\nshow up.\"  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s a long trip. You should eat something.\" He said he could buy her some bread and goat \\ncheese.  \\n \\n  \"I thoug ht about you all the time. I used to pray that you\\'d live to be a hundred years old. I \\ndidn\\'t know. I didn\\'t know that you were ashamed of me.\"  \\n  Jalil looked down, and, like an overgrown child, dug at something with the toe of his shoe.  \\n \\n  \"You were asham ed of me.\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'ll visit you,\" he muttered \"I\\'ll come to Kabul and see you.

She made her way down  the aisle to the \\nback, where Rasheed sat with her suitcase between his feet. She did not turn to look when \\nJalil\\'s palms pressed on the glass, when his knuckles rapped and rapped on it. When the bus \\njerked forward, she did not turn to see him trotting alo ngside it. And when the bus pulled \\naway, she did not look back to see him receding, to see him disappear in the cloud of \\nexhaust and dust.  \\n \\n  Rasheed, who took up the window and middle seat, put his thick hand on hers.  \\n  \"There now, girl There.

They were outside, o n the sidewalk. He had her \\nsuitcase in one hand and was unlocking the wooden front gate with the other. \"In the south \\nand west part of the city. The zoo is nearby, and the university too.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam nodded. Already she had learned that, though she could un derstand him, she had \\nto pay close attention when he spoke. She was unaccustomed to the Kabuli dialect of his \\nFarsi, and to the underlying layer of Pashto accent, the language of his native Kandahar. He, \\non the other hand, seemed to have no trouble underst anding her Herati Farsi.  \\n \\n  Mariam quickly surveyed the narrow, unpaved road along which Rasheed\\'s house was \\nsituated. The houses on this road were crowded together and shared common walls, with \\nsmall, walled yards in front buffering them from the street. Most of the homes had flat \\nroofs and were made of burned brick, some of mud the same dusty color as the mountains \\nthat ringed the city. Gutters separated the sidewalk from the road on both sides and flowed \\nwith muddy water. Mariam saw small mounds of flybl own garbage littering the street here \\nand there. Rasheed\\'s house had two stories. Mariam could see that it had once been blue.  \\n \\n  When Rasheed opened the front gate, Mariam found herself in a small, unkempt yard \\nwhere yellow grass struggled up in thin patc hes. Mariam saw an outhouse on the right, in a \\nside yard, and, on the left, a well with a hand pump, a row of dying saplings. Near the well \\nwas a toolshed, and a bicycle leaning against the wall.  \\n  \"Your father told me you like to fish,\" Rasheed said as th ey were crossing the yard to the \\nhouse. There was no backyard, Mariam saw. \"There are valleys north of here. Rivers with \\nlots of  fish. Maybe I\\'ll take you someday.\"  \\n \\n  He unlocked the front door and let her into the house.  \\n \\n  Rasheed\\'s house was much small er than Jalil\\'s, but, compared to Mariam and Nana\\'s  kolba , \\nit was a mansion. There was a hallway, a living room downstairs, and a kitchen in which he \\nshowed her pots and pans and a pressure cooker and a kerosene  ishiop.  The living room had \\na pistachio gree n leather couch. It had a rip down its side that had been clumsily sewn \\ntogether. The walls were bare. There was a table, two cane seat chairs, two folding chairs, \\nand, in the corner, a black, cast iron stove.  \\n \\n  Mariam stood in the middle of the living ro om, looking around. At the  kolba , she could \\ntouch the ceiling with her fingertips. She could lie in her cot and tell the time of day by the \\nangle of sunlight pouring through the window. She knew how far her door would open \\nbefore its hinges creaked. She kn ew every splinter and crack in each of the thirty wooden \\nfloorboards. Now all those familiar things were gone. Nana was dead, and she was here, in \\na strange city, separated from the life she\\'d known by valleys and chains of snow capped \\nmountains and entire  deserts. She was in a stranger\\'s house, with all its different rooms and \\nits smell of cigarette smoke, with its unfamiliar cupboards full of unfamiliar utensils, its \\nheavy, dark green curtains, and a ceiling she knew she could not reach.

Pangs of longing bore into her, for Nana, for Mullah Faizullah, for her \\nold life.  \\n \\n  Then she was crying.  \\n  \"What\\'s this crying about?\" Rasheed said crossly. He reached into the pocket of his pants, \\nuncurled Mariam\\'s fingers, and pushed a  handkerchief into her palm. He lit himself a \\ncigarette and leaned against the wall. He watched as Mariam pressed the handkerchief to \\nher eyes.  \\n \\n  \"Done?\"  \\n \\n  Mariam nodded.  \\n \\n  \"Sure?\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes.\"  \\n \\n  He took her by the elbow then and led her to the living roo m window.  \\n  \"This window looks north,\" he said, tapping the glass with the crooked nail of his index \\nfinger. \"That\\'s the Asmai mountain directly in front of us see? and, to the left, is the Ali \\nAbad mountain. The university is at the foot of it. Behind us,  east, you can\\'t see from here, \\nis the Shir Darwaza mountain. Every day, at noon, they shoot a cannon from it. Stop your \\ncrying, now. I mean it.\"  \\n  Mariam dabbed at her eyes.  \\n \\n  \"That\\'s one thing I can\\'t stand,\" he said, scowling, \"the sound of a woman cry ing. I\\'m sorry. \\nI have no patience for it.\"  \\n \\n  \"I want to go home,\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n  Rasheed sighed irritably. A puff of his smoky breath hit Mariam\\'s face. \"I won\\'t take that \\npersonally. This time.\"  \\n \\n  Again, he took her by the elbow, and led her upstairs.  \\n \\n  There was a narrow, dimly lit hallway there and two bedrooms. The door to the bigger one \\nwas ajar. Through it Mariam could see that it, like the rest of the house, was sparsely \\nfurnished: bed in the corner, with a brown blanket and a pillow, a closet, a dresser. The \\nwalls were bare except for a small mirror. Rasheed closed the door.  \\n \\n  \"This is my room.\"  \\n \\n  He said she could take the guest room. \"I hope you don\\'t mind. I\\'m accustomed to sleeping \\nalone.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam didn\\'t tell him how relieved she was, at  least about this.  '),\n",

It had a bed, an old, gray brown dresser, a small closet. The window looked \\ninto the yard and, beyond that, the street below. Rasheed put  her suitcase in a corner.  \\n \\n  Mariam sat on the bed.  \\n \\n  \"You didn\\'t notice,\" he said He was standing in the doorway, stooping a little to fit.  \\n \\n  \"Look on the windowsill. You know what kind they are? I put them there before leaving \\nfor Herat.\"  \\n \\n  Only now Mariam saw a basket on the sill. White tuberoses spilled from its sides.  \\n \\n  \"You like them? They please you?\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes.\"  \\n \\n  \"You can thank me then.\"  \\n \\n  \"Thank you. I\\'m sorry.  Tashakor   \" \\n \\n  \"You\\'re shaking. Maybe I scare you. Do I scare you? Are you frighte ned of me?\"  \\n  Mariam was not looking at him, but she could hear something slyly playful in these \\nquestions, like a needling. She quickly shook her head in what she recognized as her first \\nlie in their marriage.  \\n \\n  \"No? That\\'s good, then. Good for you. Well , this is your home now. You\\'re going to like it \\nhere. You\\'ll see. Did I tell you we have electricity? Most days and every night?\"  \\n \\n  He made as if to leave. At the door, he paused, took a long drag, crinkled his eyes against \\nthe smoke. Mariam thought he w as going to say something. But he didn\\'t. He closed the \\ndoor, left her alone with her suitcase and her flowers.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

She was awakened every dawn for \\nprayer by the distant cry of  azan,  after which she crawl ed back into bed. She was still \\nin bed when she heard Rasheed in the bathroom, washing up, when he came into her \\nroom to check on her before he went to his shop. From her window, she watched him in the \\nyard, securing his lunch in the rear carrier pack of h is bicycle, then walking his bicycle \\nacross the yard and into the street. She watched him pedal away, saw his broad, thick \\nshouldered figure disappear around the turn at the end of the street.  \\n \\n  For most of the days, Mariam stayed in bed, feeling adrift a nd forlorn. Sometimes she \\nwent downstairs to the kitchen, ran her hands over the sticky, grease stained counter, the \\nvinyl, flowered curtains that smelled like burned meals. She looked through the ill fitting \\ndrawers, at the mismatched spoons and knives, t he colander and chipped, wooden spatulas, \\nthese would be instruments of her new daily life, all of it reminding her of the havoc that \\nhad struck her life, making her feel uprooted, displaced, like an intruder on someone else\\'s \\nlife. \\n \\n  At the  kolba , her ap petite had been predictable. Here, her stomach rarely growled for food. \\nSometimes she took a plate of leftover white rice and a scrap of bread to the living room, \\nby the window. From there, she could see the roofs of the one story houses on their street. \\nShe could see into their yards too, the women working laundry lines and shooing their \\nchildren, chickens pecking at dirt, the shovels and spades, the cows tethered to trees.  \\n \\n  She thought longingly of all the summer nights that she and Nana had slept on th e flat roof \\nof the kolba , looking at the moon glowing over Gul Daman, the night so hot their shirts \\nwould cling to their chests like a wet leaf to a window. She missed the winter afternoons of \\nreading in the kolba  with Mullah Faizullah, the clink of icicle s falling on her roof from the \\ntrees, the crows cawing outside from snow burdened branches.  \\n  Alone in the house, Mariam paced restlessly, from the kitchen to the living room, up the \\nsteps to her room and down again. She ended up back in her room, doing he r prayers or \\nsitting on the bed, missing her mother, feeling nauseated and homesick.  \\n \\n  It was with the sun\\'s westward crawl that Mariam\\'s anxiety really ratcheted up. Her teeth \\nrattled when she thought of the night, the time when Rasheed might at last dec ide to do to \\nher what husbands did to their wives. She lay in bed, wracked with nerves, as he ate alone \\ndownstairs.  \\n \\n  He always stopped by her room and poked his head in.  \\n \\n  \"You can\\'t be sleeping already. It\\'s only seven. Are you awake? Answer me. Come, now.\"  \\n \\n  He pressed on until, from the dark, Mariam said, \"I\\'m here.\"  \\n  He slid down and sat in her doorway. From her bed, she could see his large framed body, \\nhis long legs, the smoke swirling around his hook nosed profile, the amber tip of his \\ncigarette brightening and dimming.  T '),\n",

A pair of loafers he had custom made for the deputy foreign \\nminister who, Rasheed said, bought shoes only from him. An order for sandals from a \\nPolish diplomat and his wife. He told her of the supersti tions people had about shoes: that \\nputting them on a bed invited death into the family, that a quarrel would follow if one put \\non the left shoe first.  \\n \\n  \"Unless it was done unintentionally on a Friday,\" he said. \"And did you know it\\'s \\nsupposed to be a bad  omen to tie shoes together and hang them from a nail?\"  \\n \\n  Rasheed himself believed none of this. In his opinion, superstitions were largely a female \\npreoccupation.  \\n \\n  He passed on to her things he had heard on the streets, like how the American president \\nRichard Nixon had resigned over a scandal.  \\n \\n  Mariam, who had never heard of Nixon, or the scandal that had forced him to resign, did \\nnot say anything back. She waited anxiously for Rasheed to finish talking, to crush his \\ncigarette, and take his leave. Onl y when she\\'d heard him cross the hallway, heard his door \\nopen and close, only then would the metal fist gripping her belly let go Then one night he \\ncrushed his cigarette and instead of saying good night leaned against the doorway.  \\n \\n  \"Are you ever going to  unpack that thing?\" he said, motioning with his head toward her \\nsuitcase. He crossed his arms. \"I figured you might need some time. But this is absurd. A \\nweek\\'s gone and…Well, then, as of tomorrow morning I expect you to start behaving like a \\nwife.  Fahmid i? Is that understood?\"  \\n  Mariam\\'s teeth began to chatter.  \\n \\n  \"I need an answer.\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes.\"  \\n \\n  \"Good,\" he said. \"What did you think? That this is a hotel? That I\\'m some kind of \\nhotelkeeper? Well, it…Oh. Oh.  \\n \\n  La illah u ilillah.  What did I say about the c rying? Mariam. What did I say to you about \\nthe crying?\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The next morning, after Rasheed left for work, Mariam unpacked her clothes and put them \\nin the dresser. She drew a pail of water from the well and, with a rag, washed the windows \\nof her room  and the windows to the living room downstairs  She swept the floors, beat the \\ncobwebs fluttering in the corners of the ceiling. She opened the windows to air the house.  \\n \\n  She set three cups of lentils to soak in a pot, found a knife and cut some carrots and a pair '),\n",

She searched for flour, found it in the back of one of the \\ncabinets behind a row of dirty spice jars, and made fresh dough, kneading it the way Nana \\nhad shown her, pushing the dough with the heel of her hand, folding the outer edge, turning \\nit, and pushing it away again. Once she had floured the dough, she wrapped it in a moist \\ncloth, put on a hijab,  and set out for the communal tandoor.  \\n \\n  Rasheed had told her where it was, down the street, a left then a quick right, but all \\nMariam had to do was follow the flock of women and children who were headed the same \\nway. The children Mariam saw, chasing after their mothers or running ahead of them, wore \\nshirts patched and patched again. They wore trousers that looked to o big  \\n \\n  or too small, sandals with ragged straps that flapped back and forth. They rolled discarded \\nold bicycle tires with sticks.  \\n \\n  Their mothers walked in groups of three or four, some in burqas, others not. Mariam could \\nhear their high pitched chatter , their spiraling laughs. As she walked with her head down, \\nshe caught bits of their banter, which seemingly always had to do with sick children or lazy, \\nungrateful husbands.  \\n \\n  As if the meals cook themselves.  \\n  Wallah o billah,  never a moment\\'s rest!  \\n  And he says to me, I swear it, it\\'s true, he actually says tome…  \\n \\n  This endless conversation, the tone plaintive but oddly cheerful, flew around and around \\nin a circle. On it went, down the street, around the corner, in line at the tandoor. Husbands \\nwho ga mbled. Husbands who doted on their mothers and wouldn\\'t spend a rupiah on them, \\nthe wives. Mariam wondered how so many women could suffer the same miserable luck, to \\nhave married, all of them, such dreadful men. Or was this a wifely game that she did not \\nknow about, a daily ritual, like soaking rice or making dough? Would they expect her soon \\nto join in?  \\n \\n  In the tandoor line, Mariam caught sideways glances shot at her, heard whispers. Her \\nhands began to sweat. She imagined they all knew that she\\'d been bo rn aharami,  a source \\nof shame to her father and his family. They all knew that she\\'d betrayed her mother and \\ndisgraced herself.  \\n \\n  With a corner of her hijab,  she dabbed at the moisture above her upper lip and tried to \\ngather her nerves. For a few minutes, everything went well Then someone tapped her on \\nthe shoulder. Mariam turned around and found a light skinned, plump woman wearing \\nahijab,  like her. She had short, wiry black hair and a good humored, almost perfectly round \\nface. Her lips were much fuller th an Mariam\\'s, the lower one slightly droopy, as though \\ndragged down by the big, dark mole just below the lip line. She had big greenish eyes that \\nshone at Mariam with an inviting glint.  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re Rasheed jan\\'s new wife, aren\\'t you?\" the woman said, smiling  widely.  \\n '),\n",

She found the correct street but suddenly could \\nnot remember which was Rasheed\\'s ho use. She ran up then down the street, panting, near \\ntears now, began trying doors blindly. Some were locked, others opened only to reveal \\nunfamiliar yards, barking dogs, and startled chickens. She pictured Rasheed coming home \\nto find her still searching th is way, her knee bleeding, lost on her own street. Now she did \\nstart crying. She pushed on doors, muttering panicked prayers, her face moist with tears, \\nuntil one opened, and she saw, with relief, the outhouse, the well, the toolshed. She \\nslammed the door behind her and turned the bolt. Then she was on all fours, next to the \\nwall, retching. When she was done, she crawled away, sat against the wall, with her legs \\nsplayed before her. She had never in her life felt so alone.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  When Rasheed came home th at night, he brought with him a brown paper bag.

I\\'m starving.\"  \\n \\n  She poured water for him from the  afiawa  to wash his hands with. As he dried with a \\ntowel, she put before him a steaming bowl of daal  and a plate of fluffy white rice. This was \\nthe fir st meal she had cooked for him, and Mariam wished she had been in a better state \\nwhen she made it. She\\'d still been shaken from the incident at the tandoor as she\\'d cooked, \\nand all day she had fretted about the  daal consistency, its color, worried that he would think \\nshe\\'d stirred in too much ginger or not enough turmeric.  \\n \\n  He dipped his spoon into the gold colored  daal.  \\n  Mariam swayed a bit.

What if he pushed his plate \\naway in displeasure?  \\n \\n  \"Careful,\" she managed to say. \"It\\'s hot.\"  \\n \\n  Rasheed pursed his lips and blew, then put the spoon into his mouth.  \\n  \"It\\'s good,\" he said. \"A little under -salted but good.

Of course Kabul. Where else?\" He reached into the brown paper bag. \"But \\nfirst, something I have to tell you.\"  \\n \\n  He fished a sky blue burqa from the bag. The yards of pleated cloth spilled ove r his knees \\nwhen he lifted it. He rolled up the burqa, looked at Mariam.  \\n \\n  \"I have customers, Mariam, men, who bring their wives to my shop. The women come \\nuncovered, they talk to me directly, look me in the eye without shame. They wear makeup \\nand skirts that show their knees. Sometimes they even put their feet in front of me, the \\nwomen do, for measurements, and their husbands stand there and watch. They allow it. \\nThey think nothing of a stranger touching their wives\\' bare feet! They think they\\'re being \\nmodern men, intellectuals, on account of their education, I suppose. They don\\'t see that \\nthey\\'re spoiling their own  nang  and namoos,  their honor and pride.\"  \\n  He shook his head.  \\n \\n  \"Mostly, they live in the richer parts of Kabul. I\\'ll take you there. You\\'ll see. But they\\'re \\nhere too, Mariam, in this very neighborhood, these soft men. There\\'s a teacher living down \\nthe street, Hakim is his name, and I see his wife Fariba all the time walking the streets \\nalone with nothing on her head but a scarf. It embarrasses  me, frankly, to see a man who\\'s \\nlost control of his wife.\"  \\n \\n  He fixed Mariam with a hard glare.  \\n \\n  \"But I\\'m a different breed of man, Mariam. Where I come from, one wrong look, one \\nimproper word, and blood is spilled. Where I come from, a woman\\'s face is  her husband\\'s \\nbusiness only. I want you to remember that. Do you understand?\"  \\n  Mariam nodded. When he extended the bag to her, she took it.  \\n \\n  The earlier pleasure over his approval of her cooking had evaporated. In its stead, a \\nsensation of shrinking. T his man\\'s will felt to Mariam as imposing and immovable as the \\nSafid koh mountains looming over Gul Daman.  \\n \\n  Rasheed passed the paper bag to her. \"We have an understanding, then. Now, let me have \\nsome more of that  daal.\"  \\n \\n '),\n",

Rasheed had to help her put it on. The padded \\nheadpiece felt tight and heavy on her skull, and it was strange seeing the world \\nthrough a mesh screen. She practiced walking around her room in it and kept stepping on \\nthe hem and stumbling. The los s of peripheral vision was unnerving, and she did not like \\nthe suffocating way the pleated cloth kept pressing against her mouth.  \\n \\n  \"You\\'ll get used to it,\" Rasheed said. \"With time, I bet you\\'ll even like it.\"  \\n  They took a bus to a place Rasheed called the Shar -e-Nau Park, where children pushed \\neach other on swings and slapped volleyballs over ragged nets tied to tree trunks. They \\nstrolled together and watched boys fly kites, Mariam walking beside Rasheed, tripping now \\nand then on the burqa\\'s hem. For lu nch, Rasheed took her to eat in a small kebab house near \\na mosque he called the Haji Yaghoub. The floor was sticky and the air smoky. The walls \\nsmelled faintly of raw meat and the music, which Rasheed described to her as logari,  was \\nloud. The cooks were thi n boys who fanned skewers with one hand and swatted gnats with \\nthe other. Mariam, who had never been inside a restaurant, found it odd at first to sit in a \\ncrowded room with so many strangers, to lift her burqa to put morsels of food into her \\nmouth. A hint  of the same anxiety as the day at the tandoor stirred in her stomach, but \\nRasheed\\'s presence was of some comfort, and, after a while, she did not mind so much the \\nmusic, the smoke, even the people. And the burqa, she learned to her surprise, was also \\ncomf orting. It was like a one way window. Inside it, she was an observer, buffered from the \\nscrutinizing eyes of strangers. She no longer worried that people knew, with a single glance, \\nall the shameful secrets of her past.  \\n \\n  On the streets, Rasheed named var ious buildings with authority; this is the American \\nEmbassy, he said, that the Foreign Ministry. He pointed to cars, said their names and where \\nthey were made: Soviet Volgas, American Chevrolets, German Opels.  \\n \\n  \"Which is your favorite?\" he asked  \\n  Mariam  hesitated, pointed to a Volga, and Rasheed laughed  \\n \\n  Kabul was far more crowded than the little that Mariam had seen of Herat. There were \\nfewer trees and fewer  garis  pulled by horses, but more cars, taller buildings, more traffic \\nlights and more paved ro ads. And everywhere Mariam heard the city\\'s peculiar dialect: \\n\"Dear\" was  jon instead  of  jo, \"sister\" became  hamshira  instead of  hamshireh,  and so on.  \\n \\n  From a street vendor, Rasheed bought her ice cream. It was the first time she\\'d eaten ice \\ncream and Ma riam had never imagined that such tricks could be played on a palate. She \\ndevoured the entire bowl, the crushed pistachio topping, the tiny rice noodles at the bottom. \\nShe marveled at the bewitching texture, the lapping sweetness of it.  \\n \\n  They walked on t o a place called Kocheh Morgha, Chicken Street. It was a narrow, \\ncrowded bazaar in a neighborhood that Rasheed said was one of Kabul\\'s wealthier ones.  \\n  \"Around here is where foreign diplomats live, rich businessmen, members of the royal \\nfamily that sort o f people. Not like you and me.\"  M '),\n",

Rasheed stopped to look at an engraved silver dagger in one shop, and, in \\nanother, at an old rifle that the shopkeeper assured Rasheed was a relic from the first war \\nagainst the British.  \\n \\n  \"And I\\'m Moshe Dayan,\" Rasheed muttered. He half smiled, and it s eemed to Mariam that \\nthis was a smile meant only for her. A private, married smile.  \\n \\n  They strolled past carpet shops, handicraft shops, pastry shops, flower shops, and shops \\nthat sold suits for men and dresses for women, and, in them, behind lace curtain s, Mariam \\nsaw young girls sewing buttons and ironing collars. From time to time, Rasheed greeted a \\nshopkeeper he knew, sometimes in Farsi, other times in Pashto. As they shook hands and \\nkissed on the cheek, Mariam stood a few feet away. Rasheed did not wav e her over, did not \\nintroduce her.  \\n \\n  He asked her to wait outside an embroidery shop. \"I know the owner,\" he said. \"I\\'ll just go \\nin for a minute, say my  salaam.  \" \\n \\n  Mariam waited outside on the crowded sidewalk. She watched the cars crawling up \\nChicken S treet, threading through the horde of hawkers and pedestrians, honking at \\nchildren and donkeys who wouldn\\'t move. She watched the bored looking merchants inside \\ntheir tiny stalls, smoking, or spitting into brass spittoons, their faces emerging from the \\nshadows now and then to peddle textiles and fur collared poosiin coats to passersby.  \\n \\n  But it was the women who drew Mariam\\'s eyes the most.  \\n \\n  The women in this part of Kabul were a different breed from the women in the poorer \\nneighborhoods like the one where  she and Rasheed lived, where so many of the women \\ncovered fully. These women were what was the word Rasheed had used? \"modern.\" Yes, \\nmodern Afghan women married to modern Afghan men who did not mind that their wives \\nwalked among strangers with makeup on t heir faces and nothing on their heads. Mariam \\nwatched them cantering uninhibited down the street, sometimes with a man, sometimes \\nalone, sometimes with rosy cheeked children who wore shiny shoes and watches with \\nleather bands, who walked bicycles with high  rise handlebars and gold colored spokes \\nunlike the children in Deh Mazang, who bore sand fly scars on their cheeks and rolled old \\nbicycle tires with sticks.  \\n \\n  These women were all swinging handbags and rustling skirts. Mariam even spotted one \\nsmoking beh ind the wheel of a car. Their nails were long, polished pink or orange, their lips \\nred as tulips. They walked in high heels, and quickly, as if on perpetually urgent business. \\nThey wore dark sunglasses, and, when they breezed by, Mariam caught a whiff of t heir \\nperfume. She imagined that they all had university degrees, that they worked in office '),\n",

These women mystified Mariam. They made he r aware \\nof her own lowliness, her plain looks, her lack of aspirations, her ignorance of so many \\nthings.  \\n  Then Rasheed was tapping her on the shoulder and handing her something here.  \\n \\n  It was a dark maroon silk shawl with beaded fringes and edges embroid ered with gold \\nthread  \\n \\n  \"Do you like it?\"  \\n \\n  Mariam looked up. Rasheed did a touching thing then. He blinked and averted her gaze.  \\n \\n  Mariam thought of Jalil, of the emphatic, jovial way in which he\\'d pushed his jewelry at \\nher, the overpowering cheerfulne ss that left room for no response but meek gratitude. Nana \\nhad been right about Mil\\'s gifts. They had been halfhearted tokens of penance, insincere, \\ncorrupt gestures meant more for his own appeasement than hers. This shawl, Mariam saw, \\nwas a true gift.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s beautiful,\" she said.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  That night, Rasheed visited her room again. But instead of smoking in the doorway, he \\ncrossed the room and sat beside her where she lay on the bed. The springs creaked as the \\nbed tilted to his side.  \\n \\n  There was a mome nt of hesitation, and then his hand was on her neck, his thick fingers \\nslowly pressing the knobs in the back of it. His thumb slid down, and now it was stroking \\nthe hollow above her collarbone, then the flesh beneath it. Mariam began shivering. His \\nhand cr ept lower still, lower, his fingernails catching in the cotton of her blouse.  \\n  \"I can\\'t,\" she croaked, looking at his moonlit profile, his thick shoulders and broad chest, \\nthe tufts of gray hair protruding from his open collar.  \\n \\n  His hand was on her righ t breast now, squeezing it hard through the blouse, and she could \\nhear him breathing deeply through the nose.  \\n \\n  He slid under the blanket beside her. She could feel his hand working at his belt, at the \\ndrawstring of her trousers. Her own hands clenched th e sheets in fistfuls. He rolled on top \\nof her, wriggled and shifted, and she let out a whimper. Mariam closed her eyes, gritted her \\nteeth.  \\n \\n  The pain was sudden and astonishing. Her eyes sprang open. She sucked air through her \\nteeth and bit on the knuckle  of her thumb. She slung her free arm over Rasheed\\'s back and \\nher fingers dug at his shirt.  \\n '),\n",

The air between them smelled of tobacco, of the onions and grilled lamb they had \\neaten earlier. Now and then, his ear rubbed against her cheek, and she knew from the \\nscratchy feel that he had shaved it.  \\n \\n  When it was done, he rolle d off her, panting. He dropped his forearm over his brow. In the \\ndark, she could see the blue hands of his watch. They lay that way for a while, on their \\nbacks, not looking at each other.  \\n \\n  \"There is no shame in this, Mariam,\" he said, slurring a little. \"It\\'s what married people do. \\nIt\\'s what the Prophet himself and his wives did There is no shame.\"  \\n  A few moments later, he pushed back the blanket and left the room, leaving her with the \\nimpression of his head on her pillow, leaving her to wait out the pa in down below, to look \\nat the frozen stars in the sky and a cloud that draped the face of the moon like a wedding \\nveil. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

For the first time in her life, Mariam saw how \\nthe sighting of the new crescent moon co uld transform an entire city, alter its rhythm \\nand mood. She noticed a drowsy hush overtaking Kabul Traffic became languid, scant, \\neven quiet. Shops emptied. Restaurants turned off their lights, closed their doors. Mariam \\nsaw no smokers on the streets, no cups of tea steaming from window ledges. And at  ifiar,  \\nwhen the sun dipped in the west and the cannon fired from the Shir Darwaza mountain, the \\ncity broke its fast, and so did Mariam, with bread and a date, tasting for the first time in her \\nfifteen years t he sweetness of sharing in a communal experience.  \\n \\n  Except for a handful of days, Rasheed didn\\'t observe the fast. The few times he did, he \\ncame home in a sour mood. Hunger made him curt, irritable, impatient. One night, Mariam \\nwas a few minutes late with  dinner, and he started eating bread with radishes. Even after \\nMariam put the rice and the lamb and okra  qurma  in front of him, he wouldn\\'t touch it. He \\nsaid nothing, and went on chewing the bread, his temples working, the vein on his forehead, \\nfull and an gry. He went on chewing and staring ahead, and when Mariam spoke to him he \\nlooked at her without seeing her face and put another piece of bread into his mouth.  \\n \\n  Mariam was relieved when Ramadan ended.  \\n  Back at the kolba , on the first of three days of Ei d ul Fitr celebration that followed \\nRamadan, Jalil would visit Mariam and Nana. Dressed in suit and tie, he would come \\nbearing Eid presents. One year, he gave Mariam a wool scarf. The three of them would sit \\nfor tea and then Jalil would excuse himself \"Off  to celebrate Eid with his real family,\" Nana \\nwould say as he crossed the stream and waved Mullah Faizullah would come too. He would \\nbring Mariam chocolate candy wrapped in foil, a basketful of dyed boiled eggs, cookies. \\nAfter he was gone, Mariam would cli mb one of the willows with her treats. Perched on a \\nhigh branch, she would eat Mullah Faizullah\\'s chocolates and drop the foil wrappers until \\nthey lay scattered about the trunk of the tree like silver blossoms. When the chocolate was \\ngone, she would start in on the cookies, and, with a pencil, she would draw faces on the \\neggs he had brought her now. But there was little pleasure in this for her. Mariam dreaded \\nEid, this time of hospitality and ceremony, when families dressed in their best and visited \\neach o ther. She would imagine the air in Herat crackling with merriness, and high spirited, \\nbright eyed people showering each other with endearments and goodwill. A forlornness \\nwould descend on her like a shroud then and would lift only when Eid had passed.  \\n  This year, for the first time, Mariam saw with her eyes the Eid of her childhood \\nimaginings.  \\n  Rasheed and she took to the streets. Mariam had never walked amid such liveliness. \\nUndaunted by the chilly weather, families had flooded the city on their frenetic  rounds to \\nvisit relatives. On their own street, Mariam saw Fariba and her son Noor, who was dressed \\nin a suit. Fariba, wearing a white scarf, walked beside a small boned, shy looking man with \\neyeglasses. Her older son was there too Mariam somehow remember ed Fariba saying his \\nname, Ahmad, at the tandoor that first time. He had deep set, brooding eyes, and his face \\nwas more thoughtful, more solemn, than his younger brother\\'s, a face as suggestive of early \\nmaturity as his brother\\'s was of lingering boyishness . Around Ahmad\\'s neck was a \\nglittering allah pendant.  R '),\n",

She waved, and called \\nout, \"Eidmubarak!\"  \\n \\n  From inside the burqa, Mariam gave her a ghost of a nod.  \\n  \"So you know that woman, the t eacher\\'s wife?\" Rasheed said  \\n  Mariam said she didn\\'t.  \\n \\n  \"Best you stay away. She\\'s a nosy gossiper, that one. And the husband fancies himself \\nsome kind of educated intellectual But he\\'s a mouse. Look at him. Doesn\\'t he look like a \\nmouse?\"  \\n \\n  They went to  Shar-e-Nau, where kids romped about in new shirts and beaded, brightly \\ncolored vests and compared Eid gifts. Women brandished platters of sweets. Mariam saw \\nfestive lanterns hanging from shop  windows, heard music blaring from loudspeakers. \\nStrangers calle d out  \"Eidmubarak\" to  her as they passed.  \\n \\n  That night they went to  Chaman,  and, standing behind Rasheed, Mariam watched \\nfireworks light up the sky, in flashes of green, pink, and yellow. She missed sitting with \\nMullah Faizullah outside the kolba , watchin g the fireworks explode over Herat in the \\ndistance, the sudden bursts of color reflected in her tutor\\'s soft, cataract riddled eyes. But, \\nmostly, she missed Nana. Mariam wished her mother were alive to see this. To see her, \\namid all of it. To see at last th at contentment and beauty were not unattainable things. Even \\nfor the likes of them.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  They had Eid visitors at the house. They were all men, friends of Rasheed\\'s. When a \\nknock came, Mariam knew to go upstairs to her room and close the door. She sta yed there, \\nas the men sipped tea downstairs with Rasheed, smoked, chatted. Rasheed had told Mariam \\nthat she was not to come down until the visitors had left  \\n  Mariam didn\\'t mind. In truth, she was even flattered. Rasheed saw sanctity in what they \\nhad toget her. Her honor, her  namoos,  was something worth guarding to him. She felt prized \\nby his protectiveness. Treasured and significant.  \\n \\n  On the third and last day of Eid, Rasheed went to visit some friends. Mariam, who\\'d had a \\nqueasy stomach all night, boiled  some water and made herself a cup of green tea sprinkled \\nwith crushed cardamom. In the living room, she took in the aftermath of the previous \\nnight\\'s Eid visits: the overturned cups, the half chewed pumpkin seeds stashed between \\nmattresses, the plates cru sted with the outline of last night\\'s meal. Mariam set about \\ncleaning up the mess, marveling at how energetically lazy men could be.  \\n \\n  She didn\\'t mean to go into Rasheed\\'s room. But the cleaning took her from the living room \\nto the stairs, and then to the  hallway upstairs and to his door, and, the next thing she knew, \\nshe was in his room for the first time, sitting on his bed, feeling like a trespasser.  \\n '),\n",

She \\nspotted a pack of cigarettes atop the dresser beside his bed. She put one between her lips \\nand stood before the small oval mirror on the wall. She puffed air into the mirror and  made \\nash tapping motions. She put it back. She could never manage the seamless grace with \\nwhich Kabuli women smoked. On her, it looked coarse, ridiculous.  \\n \\n  Guiltily, she slid open the top drawer of his dresser.  \\n \\n  She saw the gun first. It was black, wi th a wooden grip and a short muzzle. Mariam made \\nsure to memorize which way it was facing before she picked it up. She turned it over in her \\nhands. It was much heavier than it looked. The grip felt smooth in her hand, and the muzzle \\nwas cold. It was disqui eting to her that Rasheed owned something whose sole purpose was \\nto kill another person. But surely he kept it for their safety. Her safety.  \\n  Beneath the gun were several magazines with curling corners. Mariam opened one. \\nSomething inside her dropped. Her  mouth gaped of its own will.  \\n \\n  On every page were women, beautiful women, who wore no shirts, no trousers, no socks \\nor underpants. They wore nothing at all. They lay in beds amid tumbled sheets and gazed \\nback at Mariam with half lidded eyes. In most of t he pictures, their legs were apart, and \\nMariam had a full view of the dark place between. In some, the women were prostrated as \\nif God forbid this thought in  sujda  for prayer. They looked back over their shoulders with a \\nlook of bored contempt.  \\n \\n  Mariam q uickly put the magazine back where she'd found it. She felt drugged. Who were \\nthese women? How could they allow themselves to be photographed this way? Her \\nstomach revolted with distaste. Was this what he did then, those nights that he did not visit \\nher ro om? Had she been a disappointment to him in this particular regard? And what about \\nall his talk of honor and propriety, his disapproval of the female customers, who, after all, \\nwere only showing him their feet to get fitted for shoes?  A woman's face,  he'd said, is her \\nhusband's business only.  Surely the women on these pages had husbands, some of them \\nmust. At the least, they had brothers. If so, why did Rasheed insist that  she cover when he \\nthought nothing of looking at the private areas of other men's wive s and sisters?  \\n \\n  Mariam sat on his bed, embarrassed and confused She cupped her face with her hands and \\nclosed her eyes. She breathed and breathed until she felt calmer.  \\n  Slowly, an explanation presented itself He was a man, after all, living alone for y ears \\nbefore she had moved in. His needs differed from hers. For her, all these months later, their \\ncoupling was still an exercise in tolerating pain. His appetite, on the other hand, was fierce, \\nsometimes bordering on the violent. The way he pinned her dow n, his hard squeezes at her \\nbreasts, how furiously his hips worked. He was a man. All those years without a woman. \\nCould she fault him for being the way God had created him?  \\n \\n  Mariam knew that she could never talk to him about this. It was unmentionable. But was it \\nunforgivable? She only had to think of the other man in her life. Jalil, a husband of three \\nand father of nine at the time, having relations with Nana out of wedlock.

And what entitled her anyway, a villager, \\naharami,  to pass judgment?  \\n \\n  Mariam tried the bottom drawer of the dresser.  \\n \\n  It was there that she found a picture of the boy, Yunus. It was black and white. He looked \\nfour, maybe five. He was wearing a striped shirt and a bow ti e. He was a handsome little \\nboy, with a slender nose, brown hair, and dark, slightly sunken eyes. He looked distracted, \\nas though something had caught his eye just as the camera had flashed.  \\n \\n  Beneath that, Mariam found another photo, also black and white , this one slightly more \\ngrainy. It was of a seated woman and, behind her, a thinner, younger Rasheed, with black \\nhair. The woman was beautiful. Not as beautiful as the women in the magazine, perhaps, \\nbut beautiful. Certainly more beautiful than her, Maria m. She had a delicate chin and long, \\nblack hair parted in the center. High cheekbones and a gentle forehead. Mariam pictured \\nher own face, her thin lips and long chin, and felt a flicker of jealousy.  \\n  She looked at this photo for a long time. There was so mething vaguely unsettling about \\nthe way Rasheed seemed to loom over the woman. His hands on her shoulders. His \\nsavoring, tight lipped smile and her unsmiling, sullen face. The way her body tilted forward \\nsubtly, as though she were trying to wriggle free o f his hands.  \\n \\n  Mariam put everything back where she'd found it.  \\n \\n  Later, as she was doing laundry, she regretted that she had sneaked around in his room. \\nFor what? What thing of substance had she learned about him? That he owned a gun, that \\nhe was a man with the needs of a man? And she shouldn't have stared at the photo of him \\nand his wife for as long as she had. Her eyes had read meaning into what was random body \\nposture captured in a single moment of time.  \\n  What Mariam felt now, as the loaded clothesli nes bounced heavily before her, was sorrow \\nfor Rasheed. He too had had a hard life, a life marked by loss and sad turns of fate. Her \\nthoughts returned to his boy Yunus, who had once built snowmen in this yard, whose feet \\nhad pounded these same stairs. The lake had snatched him from Rasheed, swallowed him \\nup, just as a whale had swallowed the boy's namesake prophet in the Koran. It pained \\nMariam it pained her considerably to picture Rasheed panic stricken and helpless, pacing \\nthe banks of the lake and pleadi ng with it to spit his son back onto dry land. And she felt for \\nthe first time a kinship with her husband. She told herself that they would make good \\ncompanions after all.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \"),\n",

It was as \\nthough a rainbow had melted into her eyes.  \\n  Rasheed was drumming his gl oved fingers and humming a song. Every time the bus \\nbucked over a pothole and jerked forward, his hand shot protectively over her belly.  \\n \\n  \"What about Zalmai?\" he said. \"It\\'s a good Pashtun name.\"  \\n \\n  \"What if it\\'s a girl?\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n  \"I think it\\'s a boy. Yes. A boy.\"  \\n \\n  A murmur was passing through the bus. Some passengers were pointing at something and \\nother passengers were leaning across seats to see.  \\n \\n  \"Look,\" said Rasheed, tapping a knuckle on the glass. He was smiling. \"There. See?\"  \\n \\n  On the st reets, Mariam saw people stopping in their tracks. At traffic lights, faces emerged \\nfrom the windows of cars, turned upward toward the falling softness. What was it about a \\nseason\\'s first snowfall, Mariam wondered, that was so entrancing? Was it the chance  to see \\nsomething as yet unsoiled, untrodden? To catch the fleeting grace of a new season, a lovely \\nbeginning, before it was trampled and corrupted?  \\n  \"If it\\'s a girl,\" Rasheed said, \"and it isn\\'t, but, if it is a girl, then you can choose whatever \\nname you  want.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mahiam awoke the next morning to the sound of sawing and hammering  She wrapped a \\nshawl around her and went out into the snow -blown yard.

Kabul was eerily silent, quilted \\nin white, tendrils of smoke snaking up here and there.  \\n \\n  She found Rasheed in the toolshed, pounding nails into a plank of wood. When he saw her, \\nhe removed a nail from the corner of his mouth.  \\n \\n  \"It was going to be a surprise. He\\'ll need a crib.

As he began to saw it in half, he said the stairs \\nworried him. \"Something will have to be done about them later, when he\\'s old enough to \\nclimb.\" The stove worried him too, he said. The knives and forks would have to be stowed \\nsomewhere out of reach. \"You  can\\'t be too careful Boys are reckless creatures.\"  \\n  Mariam pulled the shawl around her against the chill.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The next morning, Rasheed said he wanted to invite his friends for dinner to celebrate. All \\nmorning, Mariam cleaned lentils and moistened rice. She sliced eggplants for  borani,  and \\ncooked leeks and ground beef for  aushak.  She swept the floor, beat the curtains, aired the \\nhouse, despite the snow that had started up again. She arranged mattresses and cushions \\nalong the walls of the living room , placed bowls of candy and roasted almonds on the table.  \\n \\n  She was in her room by early evening before the first of the men arrived. She lay in bed as \\nthe hoots and laughter and bantering voices downstairs began to mushroom. She couldn\\'t \\nkeep her hands f rom drifting to her belly. She thought of what was growing there, and \\nhappiness rushed in like a gust of wind blowing a door wide open. Her eyes watered.  \\n \\n  Mariam thought of her six hundred and fifty kilometer bus trip with Rasheed, from Herat \\nin the west , near the border with Iran, to Kabul in the east. They had passed small towns \\nand big towns, and knots of little villages that kept springing up one after another. They had \\ngone over mountains and across raw burned deserts, from one province to the next. And \\nhere she was now, over those boulders and parched hills, with a home of her own, a \\nhusband of her own, heading toward one final, cherished province: Motherhood. How \\ndelectable it was to think of  \\n  this baby,  her baby,  their  baby. How glorious it was to  know that her love for it already \\ndwarfed anything she had ever felt as a human being, to know that there was no need any \\nlonger for pebble games.  \\n \\n  Downstairs, someone was tuning a harmonium. Then the clanging of a hammer tuning a \\ntabla. Someone cleared  his throat. And then there was whistling and clapping and yipping \\nand singing.  \\n \\n  Mariam stroked the softness of her belly.  No bigger than a  fingernail,  the doctor had said.  \\n \\n  I\\'m going to be a mother,  she thought.  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m going to be a mother,\" she said . Then she was laughing to herself, and saying it over \\nand over, relishing the words.  \\n \\n  When Mariam thought of this baby, her heart swelled inside of her. It swelled and swelled \\nuntil all the loss, all the grief, all the loneliness and self abasement of h er life washed away. \\nThis was why God had brought her here, all the way across the country. She knew this now. \\nShe remembered a verse from the Koran that Mullah Faizullah had taught her:  And Allah is '),\n",

When she was done, she cupped her hands before her \\nface and asked God not to let all this good fortune slip away from her.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  It was Rasheed\\'S idea to go to the  hamam.  Mariam had neve r been to a bathhouse, but he \\nsaid there was nothing finer than stepping out and taking that first breath of cold air, to feel \\nthe heat rising from the skin.  \\n  In the women\\'s  hamam,  shapes moved about in the steam around Mariam, a glimpse of a \\nhip here, th e contour of a shoulder there. The squeals of young girls, the grunts of old \\nwomen, and the trickling of bathwater echoed between the walls as backs were scrubbed \\nand hair soaped. Mariam sat in the far corner by herself, working on her heels with a \\npumice stone, insulated by a wall of steam from the passing shapes.  \\n \\n  Then there was blood and she was screaming.  \\n \\n  The sound of feet now, slapping against the wet cobblestones. Faces peering at her \\nthrough the steam. Tongues clucking.  \\n \\n  Later that night, in b ed, Fariba told her husband that when she\\'d heard the cry and rushed \\nover she\\'d found Rasheed\\'s wife shriveled into a corner, hugging her knees, a pool of blood \\nat her feet.  \\n \\n  \"You could hear the poor girl\\'s teeth rattling, Hakim, she was shivering so har d.\" \\n  When Mariam had seen her, Fariba said, she had asked in a high, supplicating voice,  It\\'s \\nnormal, isn\\'t it? Isn\\'t it? Isn’t it normal?  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Another bus ride with Rasheed. Snowing again. Falling thick this time. It was piling in \\nheaps on sidewalks , on roofs, gathering in patches on the bark of straggly trees.

His eyes \\nwere closed  He wasn\\'t humming. Mariam reclined her head and closed her eyes too. She \\nwanted out of her cold socks, out of the damp wool sweater that was prickly against her \\nskin. She wanted away from this bus.  \\n  At the house, Rasheed covered her with a quilt when she  lay on the couch, but there was a \\nstiff, perfunctory air about this gesture.  \\n \\n  \"What kind of answer is that?\" he said again. \"That\\'s what a mullah is supposed to say. \\nYou pay a doctor his fee, you want a better answer than \\'God\\'s will.\\'\"  \\n  Mariam curled up her knees beneath the quilt and said he ought to get some rest.  \\n  \"God\\'s will,\" he simmered.  \\n \\n  He sat in his room smoking cigarettes all day.

All it took to unleash it was her thinking of the \\nunfinished crib in the toolshed or the suede coat i n Rasheed's closet. The baby came to \\nlife then and she could hear it, could hear its hungry grunts, its gurgles and jabbering  She \\nfelt it sniffing at her breasts. The grief washed over her, swept her up, tossed her upside \\ndown. Mariam was dumbfounded that  she could miss in such a crippling manner a being \\nshe had never even seen.  \\n \\n  Then there were days when the dreariness didn't seem quite as unrelenting to Mariam. \\nDays when the mere thought of resuming the old patterns of her life did not seem so \\nexhausti ng, when it did not take enormous efforts of will to get out of bed, to do her prayers, \\nto do the wash, to make meals for Rasheed.  \\n \\n  Mariam dreaded going outside. She was envious, suddenly, of the neighborhood women \\nand their wealth of children. Some had seven or eight and didn't understand how fortunate \\nthey were, how blessed that their children had flourished in their wombs, lived to squirm in \\ntheir arms and take the milk from their breasts. Children that they had not bled away with \\nsoapy water and the b odily filth of strangers down some bathhouse drain. Mariam resented \\nthem when she overheard them complaining about misbehaving sons and lazy daughters.  \\n \\n  A voice inside her head tried to soothe her with well intended but misguided consolation.  \\n \\n  You’ll have others,  Inshallah.  You 're young. Surely you‘ll have many other chances.  \\n \\n  But Mariam's grief wasn't aimless or unspecific. Mariam grieved for  this baby, this \\nparticular child, who had made her so happy for a while Some days, she believed that the \\nbaby had been an undeserved blessing, that she was being punished for what she had done \\nto Nana. Wasn't it true that she might as well have slipped that noose around her mother's \\nneck herself? Treacherous daughters did not deserve to be mothers, and this was just \\npunishment  She had fitful dreams, of  Nana's jinn sneaking into her room at night, \\nburrowing its claws into her womb, and stealing her baby. In these dreams, Nana cackled \\nwith delight and vindication.  \\n \\n  Other days, Mariam was besieged with anger. It was Rasheed's fault for his premature \\ncelebration. For his foolhardy faith that she was carrying a boy. Naming the baby as he had. \\nTaking God's will for granted. His fault, for making her go to the bathhouse. Something \\nthere, the steam, the dirty water, th e soap, something there had caused this to happen. No. \\nNot Rasheed.  She was to blame. She became furious with herself for sleeping in the wrong \\nposition, for eating meals that were too spicy, for not eating enough fruit, for drinking too \\nmuch tea.  \\n \\n  It wa s God's fault, for taunting her as He had. For not granting her what He had granted so \\nmany other women. For dangling before her, tantalizingly, what He knew would give her \\nthe greatest happiness, then pulling it away.  \\n T \"),\n",

It was  kojr, sacrilege, to think these thoughts. Allah was not spiteful. He was not a \\npetty God. Mullah Faizullah\\'s words whispered in her head:  \\n \\n  Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom , and He Who has power over all things, Who \\ncreated death and life that He may try you.  \\n \\n  Ransacked with guilt, Mariam would kneel and pray for forgiveness for these thoughts.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Meanwhile, a change had come over Rasheed ever since the day at the b athhouse. Most \\nnights when he came home, he hardly talked anymore. He ate, smoked, went to bed, \\nsometimes came back in the middle of the night for a brief and, of late, quite rough session \\nof coupling. He was more apt to sulk these days, to fault her cooki ng, to complain about \\nclutter around the yard or point out even minor uncleanliness in the house. Occasionally, he \\ntook her around town on Fridays, like he used to, but on the sidewalks he walked quickly \\nand always a few steps ahead of her, without speakin g, unmindful of Mariam who almost \\nhad to run to keep up with him. He wasn\\'t so ready with a laugh on these outings anymore. \\nHe didn\\'t buy her sweets or gifts, didn\\'t stop and name places to her as he used to. Her \\nquestions seemed to irritate him.  \\n \\n  One ni ght, they were sitting in the living room listening to the radio. Winter was passing. \\nThe stiff winds that plastered snow onto the face and made the eyes water had calmed. \\nSilvery fluffs of snow were melting off the branches of tall elms and would be repla ced in a \\nfew weeks with stubby, pale green buds. Rasheed was shaking his foot absently to the tabla \\nbeat of a Hamahang song, his eyes crinkled against cigarette smoke.  \\n \\n  \"Are you angry with me?\" Mariam asked.  \\n \\n  Rasheed said nothing. The song ended and th e news came on.

He \\nrubbed his  forehead wearily. \"What now?\"  \\n  \"I\\'ve been thinking, that maybe we should have a proper burial For the baby, I mean. Just \\nus, a few prayers,  \\n  nothing more.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam had been thinking about it for a while. She did n\\'t want to forget this baby. It didn\\'t \\nseem right, not to mark this loss in some way that was permanent.  \\n \\n  \"What for? It\\'s idiotic.\"  \\n \\n  \"It would make me feel better, I think.\"  \\n \\n  \"Then you do it,\" he said sharply. \"I\\'ve already buried one son. I won\\'t b ury another.  \\n \\n  Now, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m trying to listen.\"  \\n \\n  He turned up the volume again, leaned his head back and closed his eyes.  \\n  One sunny morning that week, Mariam picked a spot in the yard and dug a hole.  \\n  \"In the name of Allah and with Alla h, and in the name of the messenger of Allah upon \\nwhom be the blessings and peace of Allah,\" she said under her breath as her shovel bit into \\nthe ground. She placed the suede coat that Rasheed had bought for the baby in the hole and \\nshoveled dirt over it.  \\n \\n  \"You make the night to pass into the day and You make the day to pass into the night, and \\nYou bring forth the living from the dead and You bring forth the dead from the living, and \\nYou give sustenance to whom You please without measure.\"  \\n  She patted th e dirt with the back of the shovel.

Through the window, \\nMariam saw neighbors milling about, chatting excitedly, transistor radios pressed to their \\nears. She saw Fariba lea ning against the wall of her house, talking with a woman who was \\nnew to Deh Mazang. Fariba was smiling, and her palms were pressed against the swell of \\nher pregnant belly. The other woman, whose name escaped Mariam, looked older than \\nFariba, and her hair h ad an odd purple tint to it. She was holding a little boy\\'s hand. Mariam \\nknew the boy\\'s name was Tariq, because she had heard this woman on the street call after \\nhim by that name.  \\n \\n  Mariam and Rasheed didn\\'t join the neighbors. They listened in on the rad io as some ten \\nthousand people poured into the streets and marched up and down Kabul\\'s government \\ndistrict. Rasheed said that Mir Akbar Khyber had been a prominent communist, and that his \\nsupporters were blaming the murder on President Daoud Khan\\'s governm ent. He didn\\'t \\nlook at her when he said this. These days, he never did anymore, and Mariam wasn\\'t ever \\nsure if she was being spoken to.  \\n \\n  \"What\\'s a communist?\" she asked.  \\n \\n  Rasheed snorted, and raised both eyebrows. \"You don\\'t know what a communist is? S uch \\na simple thing.  \\n \\n  Everyone knows. It\\'s common knowledge. You don\\'t…Bah. I don\\'t know why I\\'m \\nsurprised.\" Then he crossed his ankles on the table and mumbled that it was someone who \\nbelieved in Karl Marxist.  \\n \\n  \"Who\\'s Karl Marxist?\"  \\n \\n  Rasheed sighed.  \\n \\n  On the radio, a woman\\'s voice was saying that Taraki, the leader of the Khalq branch of \\nthe PDPA, the Afghan communist party, was in the streets giving rousing speeches to \\ndemonstrators.  \\n \\n  \"What I meant was, what do they want?\" Mariam asked. \"These com munists, what is it \\nthat they believe?\"  \\n \\n  Rasheed chortled and shook his head, but Mariam thought she saw uncertainty in the way \\nhe crossed his arms, the way his eyes shifted. \"You know nothing, do you?

Shut up.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam did.  \\n  It wasn\\'t easy tolerating him talking this way to her, to bear his scorn, his ridicule, his \\ninsults, his walking past her like she was nothing but a house cat. But after four years of \\nmarriage, Mariam saw clearly how much a woman could tolerate when she was afraid And \\nMariam  was afraid She lived in fear of his shifting moods, his volatile temperament, his \\ninsistence on steering even mundane exchanges down a confrontational path  that, on \\noccasion, he would resolve with punches, slaps, kicks, and sometimes try to make amends \\nfor with polluted apologies and sometimes not.  \\n  In the four years since the day at the bathhouse, there had been six more cycles of hopes \\nraised then dashed,  each loss, each collapse, each trip to the doctor more crushing for \\nMariam than the last. With each disappointment, Rasheed had grown more remote and \\nresentful Now nothing she did pleased him. She cleaned the house, made sure he always \\nhad a supply of cle an shirts, cooked him his favorite dishes. Once, disastrously, she even \\nbought makeup and put it on for him. But when he came home, he took one look at her and \\nwinced with such distaste that she rushed to the bathroom and washed it all off, tears of \\nshame mixing with soapy water, rouge, and mascara.  \\n \\n  Now Mariam dreaded the sound of him coming home in the evening. The key rattling, the \\ncreak of the door  these were sounds that set her heart racing. From her bed, she listened to \\nthe click clack  of his heels , to the muffled shuffling of his feet after he\\'d shed his shoes. \\nWith her ears, she took inventory of his doings: chair legs dragged across the floor, the \\nplaintive squeak of the cane seat when he sat, the clinking of spoon against plate, the flutter \\nof newspaper pages flipped, the slurping of water. And as her heart pounded, her mind \\nwondered what excuse he would use that night to pounce on her. There was always \\nsomething, some minor thing that would infuriate him, because no matter what she did to \\nplease  him, no matter how thoroughly she submitted to his wants and demands, it wasn\\'t \\nenough. She could not give him his son back. In this most essential way, she had failed him \\nseven times she had failed him and now she was nothing but a burden to him.

She was a burden to him.  \\n \\n  \"What\\'s going to happen?\" she asked him now.  \\n \\n  Rasheed shot her a sidelong glance. He made a sound between a sigh and a groan, dropped \\nhis legs from the table, and t urned off the radio. He took it upstairs to his room. He closed \\nthe door.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  On April 27, Mariam\\'s question was answered with crackling sounds and intense, sudden \\nroars.

In the distance, loud  booms resonated \\nand sudden plumes of smoke rose to the sky.  \\n \\n  \"What\\'s going on, Rasheed?\" she said. \"What is all this?\"  \\n \\n  \"God knows,\" he muttered.

Mariam remembered a time when she had enjoyed, even looked \\nforward to, cooking for Rasheed. Now cooking was an exercise in heightened anxiety.  The \\nqurma s were always too salty or too bland for his taste. The rice was judged either too \\ngreasy or too dry, the bread declared too doughy or too crispy. Rasheed\\'s faultfinding left \\nher stricken in the kitchen with self doubt.  \\n  When she brought him his  plate, the national anthem was playing on the radio.  \\n \\n  \"I made  sabzi,  \" she said.  \\n \\n  \"Put it down and be quiet.\"  \\n \\n  After the music faded, a man\\'s voice came on the radio. He announced himself as Air \\nForce Colonel Abdul Qader. He reported that earlier in  the day the rebel Fourth Armored \\nDivision had seized the airport and key intersections in the city. Kabul Radio, the ministries \\nof Communication and the Interior, and the Foreign Ministry building had also been \\ncaptured. Kabul was in the hands of the peop le now, he said proudly. Rebel MiGs had \\nattacked the Presidential Palace. Tanks had broken into the premises, and a fierce battle was \\nunder way there. Daoud\\'s loyalist forces were all but defeated, Abdul Qader said in a \\nreassuring tone.  \\n \\n  Days later, when  the communists began the summary executions of those connected with \\nDaoud Khan\\'s regime, when rumors began floating about Kabul of eyes gouged and \\ngenitals electrocuted in the Pol -e-Charkhi Prison, Mariam would hear of the slaughter that \\nhad taken place a t the Presidential Palace. Daoud Khan  had been killed, but not before the \\ncommunist rebels had killed some twenty members of his family, including women and \\ngrandchildren. There would be rumors that he had taken his own life, that he\\'d been gunned \\ndown in the heat of battle; rumors that he\\'d been saved for last, made to watch the massacre \\nof his family, then shot.  \\n  Rasheed turned up the volume and leaned in closer.  \\n \\n  \"A revolutionary council of the armed forces has been established, and our  watan  will \\nnow be known as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan,\" Abdul Qader said. \"The era of '),\n",

We have ended decades of \\ntyranny. Power is now in the hands of the masses and freedom loving people. A glor ious \\nnew era in the history of our country is afoot. A new Afghanistan is born. We assure you \\nthat you have nothing to fear, fellow Afghans. The new regime will maintain the utmost \\nrespect for principles, both Islamic and democratic. This is a time of rejo icing and \\ncelebration.\"  \\n  Rasheed turned off the radio.  \\n \\n  \"So is this good or bad?\" Mariam asked.  \\n \\n  \"Bad for the rich, by the sound of it,\" Rasheed said. \"Maybe not so bad for us.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam\\'s thoughts drifted to Jalil. She wondered if the communists wou ld go after him, \\nthen. Would they jail him? Jail his sons? Take his businesses and properties from him?  \\n \\n  \"Is this warm?\" Rasheed said, eyeing the rice.  \\n \\n  \"I just served it from the pot.\"  \\n \\n  He grunted, and told her to hand him a plate.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Down the street, as the night lit up in sudden flashes of red and yellow, an exhausted \\nFariba had propped herself up on her elbows. Her hair was matted with sweat, and droplets \\nof moisture teetered on the edge of her upper lip. At her bedside, the elderly midwife , \\nWajma, watched as Fariba\\'s husband and sons passed around the infant. They were \\nmarveling at the baby\\'s light hair, at her pink cheeks and puckered, rosebud lips, at the slits \\nof jade green eyes moving behind her puffy lids. They smiled at each other whe n they \\nheard her voice for the first time, a cry that started like the mewl of a cat and exploded into \\na healthy, full throated yowl. Noor said her eyes were like gemstones. Ahmad, who was the \\nmost religious member of the family, sang the  azan  in his baby sister\\'s ear and blew in her \\nface three times.  \\n \\n  \"Laila it is, then?\" Hakim asked, bouncing his daughter.  \\n \\n  \"Laila it is,\" Fariba said, smiling tiredly. \"Night Beauty. It\\'s perfect.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Rasheed made a ball of rice with his fingers. He put it in hi s mouth, chewed once, then \\ntwice, before grimacing and spitting it out on the  sofrah.  \\n \\n  \"What\\'s the matter?\" Mariam asked, hating the apologetic tone of her voice. She could feel \\nher pulse quickening, her skin shrinking.  \\n '),\n",

Mariam watched as he stormed out of the living room, then out of the \\nhouse, slamming the door on his way out.  \\n  Mariam kneeled to the ground and tried to pick up the grains of rice and put them back on \\nthe plate, but her hands were shaking badly , and she had to wait for them to stop. Dread \\npressed down on her chest. She tried taking a few deep breaths. She caught her pale \\nreflection in the darkened living room window and looked away.  \\n  Then she heard the front door opening, and Rasheed was back i n the living room.  \\n \\n  \"Get up,\" he said. \"Come here. Get up.\"  \\n \\n  He snatched her hand, opened it, and dropped a handful of pebbles into it.  \\n \\n  \"Put these in your mouth.\" \"What?\"  \\n \\n  \"Put. These. In your mouth.\"  \\n \\n  \"Stop it, Rasheed, I\\'m \"  \\n \\n  His powerful ha nds clasped her jaw. He shoved two fingers into her mouth and pried it \\nopen, then forced the cold, hard pebbles into it. Mariam struggled against him, mumbling, \\nbut he kept pushing the pebbles in, his upper lip curled in a sneer.  \\n  \"Now chew,\" he said.  \\n \\n  Through the mouthful of grit and pebbles, Mariam mumbled a plea. Tears were leaking \\nout of the corners of her eyes.  \\n \\n  \"CHEW!\" he bellowed. A gust of his smoky breath slammed against her face.  \\n  Mariam chewed. Something in the back of her mouth cracked.  \\n \\n  \"Good,\" Rasheed said. His cheeks were quivering. \"Now you know what your rice tastes \\nlike. Now you know what you\\'ve given me in this marriage. Bad food, and nothing else.\"  \\n \\n  Then he was gone, leaving Mariam to spit out pebbles, blood, and the fragments o f two \\nbroken molars.  \\n \\n   '),\n",

This morning, however, she knew there would be no Tariq sighting.  \\n \\n  \"How long will you be gone?\" she\\'d asked when Tariq had told her that his parents were \\ntaking him south, to the city of Ghazni, to visit his paternal uncle.  \\n \\n  \"Thirteen days.\"  \\n \\n  \"Thirteen days?\"  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s not so long. You\\'re making a face, Laila.\"  \\n \\n  \"I am not.\"  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re not  going to cry, are you?\"  \\n \\n  \"I am not going to cry! Not over you. Not in a thousand years.\"  \\n \\n  She\\'d kicked at his shin, not his artificial but his real one, and he\\'d playfully whacked the \\nback of her head.  \\n \\n  Thirteen days. Almost two weeks. And, just fiv e days in, Laila had learned a fundamental \\ntruth about time: Like the accordion on which Tariq\\'s father sometimes played old Pashto \\nsongs, time stretched and contracted depending on Tariq\\'s absence or presence . \\n \\nDownstairs, her parents were fighting. Again . Laila knew the routine: Mammy, ferocious, \\nindomitable, pacing and ranting; Babi, sitting, looking sheepish and dazed, nodding \\nobediently, waiting for the storm to pass. Laila closed her door and changed. But she could \\nstill hear them. She could still hea r her Finally, a door slammed. Pounding footsteps. \\nMammy\\'s bed creaked loudly. Babi, it seemed, would survive to see another day.  \\n \\n  \"Laila!\" he called now. \"I\\'m going to be late for work!\"  \\n \\n  \"One minute!\"  \\n  Laila put on her shoes and quickly brushed her shoulder length, blond curls in the mirror. \\nMammy always told Laila that she had inherited her hair color as well as her thick lashed, \\nturquoise green eyes, her dimpled cheeks, her high cheekbones, and the pout of her lower \\nlip, which Mammy shared from her  great grandmother, Mammy\\'s grandmother.

Her beauty was the talk of the valley. It skipped two \\ngenerations of women in our family, but it sure didn\\'t bypass you, Laila  The valley Mammy \\nreferred to was the Panjshir, th e Farsi speaking Tajik region one hundred kilometers \\nnortheast of Kabul. Both Mammy and Babi, who were first cousins, had been born and \\nraised in Panjshir; they had moved to Kabul back in 1960 as hopeful, bright -eyed \\nnewlyweds when Babi had been admitted t o Kabul University.  \\n \\n  Laila scrambled downstairs, hoping Mammy wouldn\\'t come out of her room for another \\nround. She found Babi kneeling by the screen door.  \\n \\n  \"Did you see this, Laila?\"  \\n \\n  The rip in the screen had been there for weeks. Laila hunkered dow n beside him. \"No. \\nMust be new.\"  \\n \\n  \"That\\'s what I told Fariba.\" He looked shaken, reduced, as he always did after Mammy \\nwas through with him. \"She says it\\'s been letting in bees.\"  \\n \\n  Laila\\'s heart went out to him. Babi was a small man, with narrow shoulde rs and slim, \\ndelicate hands, almost like a woman\\'s. At night, when Laila walked into Babi\\'s room, she \\nalways found the downward profile of his face burrowing into a book, his glasses perched \\non the tip of his nose. Sometimes he didn\\'t even notice that she was there. When he did, he \\nmarked his page, smiled a close -lipped, companionable smile. Babi knew most of Rumi\\'s \\nand Hafez\\'s  ghazals  by heart. He could speak at length about the struggle between Britain \\nand czarist Russia over Afghanistan. He knew the diff erence between a stalactite and a \\nstalagmite, and could tell you that the distance between the earth and the sun was the same \\nas going from Kabul to Ghazni one and a half million times. But if Laila needed the lid of a \\ncandy jar forced open, she had to go to Mammy, which felt like a betrayal. Ordinary tools \\nbefuddled Babi. On his watch, squeaky door hinges never got oiled. Ceilings went on \\nleaking after he plugged them. Mold thrived defiantly in kitchen cabinets. Mammy said that \\nbefore he left with Noor to join the jihad against the Soviets, back in 1980, it was Ahmad \\nwho had dutifully and competently minded these things.  \\n  \"But if you have a book that needs urgent reading,\" she said, \"then Hakim is your man.\"  \\n \\n  Still, Laila could not shake the feeling that  at one time, before Ahmad and Noor had gone \\nto war against the Soviets before Babi had  let them go to war Mammy too had thought \\nBabi\\'s bookishness endearing, that, once upon a time, she too had found his forgetfulness \\nand ineptitude charming.  \\n \\n  \"So what is today?\" he said now, smiling coyly. \"Day five? Or is it six?\"  \\n \\n  \"What do I care? I don\\'t keep count,\" Laila lied, shrugging, loving him for remembering  \\nMammy had no idea that Tariq had left.  \\n \\n  \"Well, his flashlight will be going off before you know i t,\" Babi said, referring to Laila \\nand Tariq\\'s nightly signaling game. They had played it for so long it had become a bedtime '),\n",

We\\'d better \\ngo.\" H e raised his voice and called over his shoulder, \"We\\'re going now, Fariba! I\\'m taking \\nLaila to school. Don\\'t forget to pick her up!\"  \\n \\n  Outside, as she was climbing on the carrier pack of Babi\\'s bicycle, Laila spotted a car \\nparked up the street, across fro m the house where the shoemaker, Rasheed, lived with his \\nreclusive wife. It was a Benz, an unusual car in this neighborhood, blue with a thick white \\nstripe bisecting the hood, the roof, and the trunk. Laila could make out two men sitting \\ninside, one behind  the wheel, the other in the back.  \\n \\n  \"Who are they?\" she said.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s not our business,\" Babi said. \"Climb on, you\\'ll be late for class.\"  \\n \\n  Laila remembered another fight, and, that time, Mammy had stood over Babi and said in a \\nmincing way,  That\\'s your  business, isn\\'t it, cousin? To make nothing your business. Even \\nyour own sons going to war. Howl pleaded with you. Bui you buried your nose in those \\ncursed books and let our sons go like they were a pair of  harami s. \\n \\n  Babi pedaled up the street, Laila on  the back, her arms wrapped around his belly. As they \\npassed the blue Benz, Laila caught a fleeting glimpse of the man in the backseat: thin, \\nwhite haired, dressed in a dark brown suit, with a white handkerchief triangle in the breast \\npocket. The only othe r thing she had time to notice was that the car had Herat license \\nplates.  \\n \\n  They rode the rest of the way in silence, except at the turns, where Babi braked cautiously \\nand said, \"Hold on, Laila. Slowing down. Slowing down. There.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  In class that day, Laila found it hard to pay attention, between Tariq\\'s absence and her \\nparents\\' fight. So when the teacher called on her to name the capitals of Romania and Cuba, \\nLaila was caught off guard.  \\n \\n  The teacher\\'s name was Shanzai, but, behind her back, the students called her Khala \\nRangmaal, Auntie Painter, referring to the motion she favored when she slapped students \\npalm, then back of the hand, back and forth, like a painter working a brush. Khala \\nRangmaal was a sharp faced young woman with heavy eyebrows.  On the first day of school, \\nshe had proudly told the class that she was the daughter of a poor peasant from Khost. She \\nstood straight, and wore her jet black hair pulled tightly back and tied in a bun so that, \\nwhen Khala Rangmaal turned around, Laila coul d see the dark bristles on her neck. Khala \\nRangmaal did not wear makeup or jewelry. She did not cover and forbade the female \\nstudents from doing it. She said women and men were equal in every way and there was no \\nreason women should cover if men didn\\'t.  '),\n",

It \\nwas kind to its workers, and its people were all equal. Everyone in the Soviet Union was \\nhappy and friendly, unlike America, where crime made people afraid to leave  their homes. \\nAnd everyone in Afghanistan would be happy too, she said, once the antiprogressives, the \\nbackward bandits, were defeated.  \\n  \"That\\'s why our Soviet comrades came here in 1979. To lend their neighbor a hand. To \\nhelp us defeat these brutes who w ant our country to be a backward, primitive nation. And \\nyou must lend your own hand, children. You must report anyone who might know about \\nthese rebels. It\\'s your duty. You must listen, then report. Even if it\\'s your parents, your \\nuncles or aunts. Because none of them loves you as much as your country does. Your \\ncountry comes first, remember! I will be proud of you, and so will your country.\"  \\n \\n  On the wall behind Khala Rangmaal\\'s desk was a map of the Soviet Union, a map of \\nAfghanistan, and a framed photo of the latest communist president, Najibullah, who, Babi \\nsaid, had once been the head of the dreaded KHAD, the Afghan secret police. There were \\nother photos too, mainly of young Soviet soldiers shaking hands with peasants, planting \\napple saplings, building  homes, always smiling genially.  \\n \\n  \"Well,\" Khala Rangmaal said now, \"have I disturbed your daydreaming,  Inqilabi  Girl?\"  \\n \\n  This was her nickname for Laila, Revolutionary Girl, because she\\'d been born the night of \\nthe April coup of 1978 except Khala Rangma al became angry if anyone in her class used \\nthe word  coup.  What had happened, she insisted, was an  inqilab,  a revolution, an uprising \\nof the working people against inequality.  Jihad was  another forbidden word. According to \\nher, there wasn\\'t even a war out there in the provinces, just skirmishes against \\ntroublemakers stirred by people she called foreign provocateurs. And certainly no one,  no \\none, dared repeat in her presence the rising rumors that, after eight years of fighting, the \\nSoviets were losing this war. Particularly now that the American president, Reagan, had \\nstarted shipping the Mujahideen Stinger Missiles to down the Soviet helicopters, now that \\nMuslims from all over the world were joining the cause: Egyptians, Pakistanis, even \\nwealthy Saudis, who  left their millions behind and came to Afghanistan to fight the jihad.  \\n  \"Bucharest. Havana,\" Laila managed.  \\n \\n  \"And are those countries our friends or not?\"  \\n \\n  \"They are,  moolim  sahib. They are friendly countries.\"  \\n \\n  Khala Rangmaal gave a curt nod.  \\n \\n* * * \\n \\n  When school let out. Mammy again didn\\'t show up like she was supposed to. Laila ended \\nup walking home with two of her classmates, Giti and Hasina.  \\n  Giti was a tightly wound, bony little girl who wore her hair in twin ponytails held by \\nelastic bands.  She was always scowling, and walking with her books pressed to her chest, \\nlike a shield. Hasina was twelve, three years older than Laila and Giti, but had failed third '),\n",

What she lacked in smarts Hasina made up for in \\nmisc hief and a mouth that, Giti said, ran like a sewing machine. It was Hasina who had \\ncome up with the Khala Rangmaal nickname Today, Hasina was dispensing advice on how \\nto fend off unattractive suitors. \"Foolproof method, guaranteed to work. I give you my \\nword.\" \\n  \"This is stupid. I\\'m too young to have a suitor!\" Giti said.  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re not too young.\"  \\n \\n  \"Well, no one\\'s come to ask for  my hand.\"  \\n \\n  \"That\\'s because you have a beard, my dear.\"  \\n \\n  Giti\\'s hand shot up to her chin, and she looked with alarm to Lail a, who smiled pityingly \\nGiti was the most humorless person Laila had ever met and shook her head with \\nreassurance.  \\n \\n  \"Anyway, you want to know what to do or not, ladies?\"  \\n \\n  \"Go ahead,\" Laila said.  \\n \\n  \"Beans. No less than four cans. On the evening the too thless lizard comes to ask for your \\nhand. But the timing, ladies, the timing is everything  You have to suppress the fireworks \\n\\'til it\\'s time to serve him his tea.\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'ll remember that,\" Laila said.  \\n \\n  \"So will he.\"  \\n \\n  Laila could have said then that sh e didn\\'t need this advice because Babi had no intention \\nof giving her away anytime soon. Though Babi worked at Silo, Kabul\\'s gigantic bread \\nfactory, where he labored amid the heat and the humming machinery stoking the massive \\novens and mill grains all day,  he was a university educated man. He\\'d been a high school \\nteacher before the communists fired him this was shortly after the coup of 1978, about a \\nyear and a half before the Soviets had invaded. Babi had made it clear to Laila from ayoung \\nage that the mos t important thing in his life, after her safety, was her schooling.  \\n  I know you\\'re still young, bu t I want you to understand and learn this now,  he said.  \\nMarriage can wait, education cannot You\\'re a very, very bright girl. Truly, you are. You \\ncan be anyth ing you want, Laila I know this about you. And I also know that when this war \\nis over, Afghanistan is going to need you as much as its men, maybe even more. Because a \\nsociety has no chance of success if its women are uneducated, Laila No chance.  \\n \\n  But Lai la didn\\'t tell Hasina that Babi had said these things, or how glad she was to have a \\nfather like him, or how proud she was of his regard for her, or how determined she was to \\npursue her education just as he had his. For the last two years, Laila had receiv ed the  awal \\nnumra  certificate, given yearly to the top ranked student in each grade.  '),\n",

Has ina had told \\nLaila, in one of her infrequent serious moments, that it had already been decided that she \\nwould marry a first cousin who was twenty years older than her and owned an auto shop in \\nLahore.  I\\'ve seen him twice,  Hasina had said.  Both times he ate  with his mouth open.  \\n \\n  \"Beans, girls,\" Hasina said. \"You remember that. Unless, of course\" here she flashed an \\nimpish grin and nudged Laila with an elbow \"it\\'s your young handsome, one legged prince \\nwho comes knocking  Then…\"  \\n \\n  Laila slapped the elbow a way. She would have taken offense if anyone else had said that \\nabout Tariq. But she knew that Hasina wasn\\'t malicious. She mocked it was what she did \\nand her mocking spared no one, least of all herself.  \\n \\n  \"You shouldn\\'t talk that way about people!\" Giti s aid. \\n \\n  \"What people is that?\"  \\n \\n  \"People who\\'ve been injured because of war,\" Giti said earnestly, oblivious to Hasina\\'s \\ntoying.  \\n \\n  \"I think Mullah Giti here has a crush on Tariq.

On anyone!\"  \\n \\n  They broke off from Laila, and, still arguing this way, turned in to their street.  \\n \\n  Laila walked alone the last three blocks. When she was on her street, she noticed that the \\nblue Benz was still parked there, outside Rasheed and Mariam\\'s house. The elderly man in \\nthe brown suit was standing by the hood now, leaning on a cane, looking up at the house.  \\n \\n  That was when a voice behind Laila said, \"Hey. Yellow Hair.

Behind the gun loomed Khadim\\'s \\ngrinning face. Khadim was eleven, like Tariq. He was thick, tall, and had a severe \\nunderbite. His father was a butcher in Deh Mazang, and, from  time to time, Khadim was \\nknown to fling bits of calf intestine at passersby. Sometimes, if Tariq wasn\\'t nearby, \\nKhadim shadowed Laila in the schoolyard at recess, leering, making little whining noises. \\nOne time, he\\'d tapped her on the shoulder and said,  You \\'re so very pretty, Yellow Hair. I \\nwant to marry you.  \\n \\n  Now he waved the gun. \"Don\\'t worry,\" he said. \"This won\\'t show. Not  on your  hair.\"  \\n \\n  \"Don\\'t you do it!

Sometimes Laila \\nwondered why Mammy had even bothered having her. People, she believed now, shouldn\\'t \\nbe allowed to have new children if they\\'d  already given away all their love to their old ones. \\nIt wasn\\'t fair. A fit of anger claimed her. Laila went to her room, collapsed on her bed.  \\n  When the worst of it had passed, she went across the hallway to Mammy\\'s door and \\nknocked. When she was younger , Laila used to sit for hours outside this door. She would \\ntap on it and whisper Mammy\\'s name over and over, like a magic chant meant to break a \\nspell:  Mammy, Mammy, Mammy, Mammy…  But Mammy never opened the door. She didn\\'t \\nopen it now. Laila turned the kn ob and walked in.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Sometimes Mammy had good days. She sprang out of bed bright eyed and playful. The \\ndroopy lower lip stretched upward in a smile. She bathed. She put on fresh clothes and \\nwore mascara. She let Laila brush her hair, which Laila lov ed doing, and pin earrings \\nthrough her earlobes. They went shopping together to Mandaii Bazaar. Laila got her to play \\nsnakes and ladders, and they ate shavings from blocks of dark chocolate, one of the few \\nthings they shared a common taste for. Laila\\'s fav orite part of Mammy\\'s good days was \\nwhen Babi came home, when she and Mammy looked up from the board and grinned at \\nhim with brown teeth. A gust of contentment puffed through the room then, and Laila \\ncaught a momentary glimpse of the tenderness, the romanc e, that had once bound her \\nparents back when this house had been crowded and noisy and cheerful.  \\n \\n  Mammy sometimes baked on her good days and invited neighborhood women over for tea \\nand pastries. Laila got to lick the bowls clean, as Mammy set the table w ith cups and \\nnapkins and the good plates. Later, Laila would take her place at the living room table and \\ntry to break into the conversation, as the women talked boisterously and drank tea and \\ncomplimented Mammy on her baking. Though there was never much fo r her to say, Laila \\nliked to sit and listen in because at these gatherings she was treated to a rare pleasure: She \\ngot to hear Mammy speaking affectionately about Babi.  \\n  \"What a first rate teacher he was,\" Mammy said. \"His students loved him. And not only  \\nbecause he wouldn\\'t beat them with rulers, like other teachers did. They respected him, you \\nsee, because he respected  them.  He was marvelous.\"  \\n \\n  Mammy loved to tell the story of how she\\'d proposed to him.  \\n \\n  \"I was sixteen, he was nineteen. Our families lived next door to each other in Panjshir. Oh, \\nI had the crush on him,  hamshiras ! I used to climb the wall between our houses, and we\\'d \\nplay in his father\\'s orchard. Hakim was always scared that we\\'d get caught and that my \\nfather would give him a slapping.  \\'Your father\\'s going to give me a slapping,\\' he\\'d always \\nsay. He was so cautious, so serious, even then. And then one day I said to him, I said, \\n\\'Cousin, what will it be? Are you going to ask for my hand or are you going to make me \\ncome  khasiegari  to you? \\' I said it just like that. You should have seen the face on him!\"  \\n \\n  Mammy would slap her palms together as the women, and Laila, laughed.  \\n  Listening to Mammy tell these stories, Laila knew that there had been a time when '),\n",

A time when her parents did not sleep in \\nseparate rooms. Laila wished she hadn\\'t missed out on those times.  \\n \\n  Inevitably, Mammy\\'s proposal story led to matchmaking schemes. When Afghanistan was \\nfree from the Soviets and the boys returned home, the y would need brides, and so, one by \\none, the women paraded the neighborhood girls who might or might not be suitable for \\nAhmad and Noon Laila always felt excluded when the talk turned to her brothers, as though \\nthe women were discussing a beloved film that  only she hadn\\'t seen. She\\'d been two years \\nold when Ahmad and Noor had left Kabul for Panjshir up north, to join Commander \\nAhmad Shah Massoud\\'s forces and fight the jihad Laila hardly remembered anything at all \\nabout them. A shiny allah pendant around Ahm ad\\'s neck. A patch of black hairs on one of \\nNoor\\'s ears. And that was it.  \\n  \"What about Azita?\"  \\n \\n  \"The rugmaker\\'s daughter?\" Mammy said, slapping her cheek with mock outrage.  \\n \\n  \"She has a thicker mustache than Hakim!\"  \\n \\n  \"There\\'s Anahita. We hear she\\'s t op in her class at Zarghoona.\"  \\n \\n  \"Have you seen the teeth on that girl? Tombstones. She\\'s hiding a graveyard behind those \\nlips.\"  \\n \\n  \"How about the Wahidi sisters?\"  \\n \\n  \"Those two dwarfs? No, no, no. Oh, no. Not for my sons. Not for my sultans. They \\ndeserve  better.\"  \\n \\n  As the chatter went on, Laila let her mind drift, and, as always, it found Tariq.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mammy had pulled the yellowish curtains. In the darkness, the room had a layered smell \\nabout it: sleep, unwashed linen, sweat, dirty socks, perfume, th e previous night\\'s left  over \\nqurma.  Laila waited for her eyes to adjust before she crossed the room. Even so, her feet \\nbecame entangled with items of clothing that littered the floor.  \\n \\n  Laila pulled the curtains open. At the foot of the bed was an old met allic folding chair. \\nLaila sat on it and watched the unmoving blanketed mound that was her mother.  \\n \\n  The walls of Mammy\\'s room were covered with pictures of Ahmad and Noor. Everywhere \\nLaila looked, two strangers smiled back. Here was Noor mounting a tricy cle. Here was \\nAhmad doing his prayers, posing beside a sundial Babi and he had built when he was \\ntwelve. And there they were, her brothers, sitting back to back beneath the old pear tree in \\nthe yard.  \\n '),\n",

From \\ntime to time, Mammy showed her the old, crumpled newspaper clippings in it, and \\npamphlets that Ahmad had managed to collect from insurgent groups and resistance \\norganizations headquartered in Pakistan. One photo, Laila remem bered, showed a man in a \\nlong white coat handing a lollipop to a legless little boy. The caption below the photo read:  \\nChildren are the intended victims of Soviet land mine campaign.  The article went on to say \\nthat the Soviets also liked to hide explosives  inside brightly colored toys. If a child picked it \\nup, the toy exploded, tore off fingers or an entire hand. The father could not join the jihad \\nthen; he\\'d have to stay home and care for his child. In another article in Ahmad\\'s box, a \\nyoung Mujahid was sa ying that the Soviets had dropped gas on his village that burned \\npeople\\'s skin and blinded them. He said he had seen his mother and sister running for the \\nstream, coughing up blood.  \\n \\n  \"Mammy.\"  \\n \\n  The mound stirred slightly. It emitted a groan.  \\n \\n  \"Get up,  Mammy. It\\'s three o\\'clock.\"  \\n \\n  Another groan. A hand emerged, like a submarine periscope breaking surface, and \\ndropped. The mound moved more discernibly this time. Then the rustle of blankets as \\nlayers of them shifted over each other. Slowly, in stages, M ammy materialized: first the \\nslovenly hair, then the white, grimacing face, eyes pinched shut against the light, a hand \\ngroping for the headboard, the sheets sliding down as she pulled herself up, grunting. \\nMammy made an effort to look up, flinched against  the light, and her head drooped over \\nher chest.  \\n \\n  \"How was school?\" she muttered.  \\n \\n  So it would begin. The obligatory questions, the perfunctory answers. Both pretending. \\nUnenthusiastic partners, the two of them, in this tired old dance.  \\n \\n  \"School was fine,\" Laila said.  \\n \\n  \"Did you learn anything?\"  \\n \\n  \"The usual.\"  \\n \\n  \"Did you eat?\"  \\n \\n  \"I did.\"  \\n \\n  \"Good.\"  \\n \\n  Mammy raised her head again, toward the window.

Is your father home?\"  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s only three.\"  \\n \\n  \"Oh. Right. You said that already.\" Mammy yawned. \"I was dreaming just now,\" she said, \\nher voice only a bit louder than the rustle of her nightgown against the sheets. \"Just now, \\nbefore you came in. But I can\\'t remember it now. Does that happen to you?\"  \\n \\n  \"It happens to everybody, Mammy.\"  \\n \\n  \"Strangest thing.\"  \\n \\n  \"I should tell you that whil e you were dreaming, a boy shot piss out of a water gun on my \\nhair.\"  \\n \\n  \"Shot what?

Laila could not tell whether this was a question. Mammy began \\npicking at her hair. This was one of life\\'s great mysteries to Laila, that Mammy\\'s picking \\nhad not made her bald as an egg. \"What about…What\\'s his name, your friend, Tariq? Yes, \\nwhat about him?\"  \\n \\n  \"He\\'s been gone for a week.\"  \\n \\n  \"Oh.\" Mammy si ghed through her nose. \"Did you wash?\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes.\"  '),\n",

Shut the curtains before you go,  my love,\" Mammy said, her voice \\nfading.

It was the blue Benz with the Herat license plate finally leaving.

Then another week c ame and went.  \\n  To fill the time, Laila fixed the screen door that Babi still hadn\\'t got around to. She \\ntook down Babi\\'s books, dusted and alphabetized them. She went to Chicken Street with \\nHasina,  Giti, and Giti\\'s mother, Nila, who was a seamstress and so metime sewing partner of \\nMammy\\'s. In that week, Laila came to believe that of all the hardships a person had to face \\nnone was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.  \\n \\n  Another week passed.  \\n \\n  Laila found herself caught in a net of terrible thoughts . \\n \\n  He would never come back. His parents had moved away for good; the trip to Ghazni had \\nbeen a ruse. An adult scheme to spare the two of them an upsetting farewell.  \\n \\n  A land minehad gotten to him again. The way it did in 1981, when he was five, the las t \\ntime his parents took him south to Ghazni. That was shortly after Laila\\'s third birthday. \\nHe\\'d been lucky that time, losing only a leg; lucky that he\\'d survived at all.  \\n \\n  Her head rang and rang with these thoughts.  \\n \\n  Then one night Laila saw a tiny fla shing light from down the street. A sound, something \\nbetween a squeak and a gasp, escaped her  lips. She quickly fished her own flashlight from \\nunder the bed, but it wouldn\\'t work. Laila banged it against her palm, cursed the dead \\nbatteries. But it didn\\'t m atter. He was back. Laila sat on the edge of her bed, giddy with \\nrelief, and watched that beautiful, yellow eye winking on and off.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  On her way to Tariq\\'s house the next day, Laila saw Khadim and a group of his friends \\nacross the street. Khadim wa s squatting, drawing something in the dirt with a stick. When \\nhe saw her, he dropped the stick and wiggled his fingers. He said something and there was \\na round of chuckles. Laila dropped her head and hurried past.  \\n \\n  \"What did you do1?\"  she exclaimed when T ariq opened the door. Only then did she \\nremember that his uncle was a barber.  \\n  Tariq ran his hand over his newly shaved scalp and smiled, showing white, slightly \\nuneven teeth.  \\n \\n  \"Like it?\"  \\n \\n  \"You look like you\\'re enlisting in the army.\"  \\n \\n  \"You want to feel?\" He lowered his head.  \\n A '),\n",

Tariq wasn\\'t like some of the other \\nboys, whose hair concealed  \\n \\n  cone shaped skulls and unsightly lumps. Tariq\\'s head was perfectly curved and lump free.  \\n \\n  When he looked  up, Laila saw that his cheeks and brow had sunburned  \\n \\n  \"What took you so long?\" she said  \\n \\n  \"My uncle was sick. Come on. Come inside.\"  \\n \\n  He led her down the hallway to the family room. Laila loved everything about this house. \\nThe shabby old rug in the f amily room, the patchwork quilt on the couch, the ordinary \\nclutter of Tariq\\'s life: his mother\\'s bolts of fabric, her sewing needles embedded in spools, \\nthe old magazines, the accordion case in the corner waiting to be cracked open.  \\n \\n  \"Who is it?\"  \\n \\n  It was his mother calling from the kitchen.  \\n \\n  \"Laila,\" he answered  \\n  He pulled her a chair. The family room was brightly lit and had double windows that \\nopened into the yard. On the sill were empty jars in which Tariq\\'s mother pickled eggplant \\nand made carrot  marmalade.  \\n \\n  \"You mean our  aroos,  our daughter in law,  \"his father announced, entering the room. He \\nwas a carpenter, a lean, white haired man in his early sixties. He had gaps between his front \\nteeth, and the squinty eyes of someone who had spent most of  his life outdoors. He opened \\nhis arms and Laila went into them, greeted by his pleasant and familiar smell of sawdust. \\nThey kissed on the cheek three times.  \\n  \"You keep calling her that and she\\'ll stop coming here,\" Tariq\\'s mother said, passing by \\nthem. S he was carrying a tray with a large bowl, a serving spoon, and four smaller bowls \\non it. She set the tray on the table. \"Don\\'t mind the old man.\" She cupped Laila\\'s face. \"It\\'s \\ngood to see you, my dear. Come, sit down. I brought back some water soaked frui t with \\nme.\"  \\n \\n  The table was bulky and made of a light, unfinished wood Tariq\\'s father had built it, as \\nwell as the chairs. It was covered with a moss green vinyl tablecloth with little magenta \\ncrescents and stars on it. Most of the living room wall was ta ken up with pictures of Tariq \\nat various ages. In some of the very early ones, he had two legs.  \\n \\n  \"I heard your brother was sick,\" Laila said to Tariq\\'s father, dipping a spoon into her bowl \\nof soaked raisins, pistachios, and apricots.  \\n \\n  He was lighting a cigarette. \"Yes, but he\\'s fine now,  shokr -e-Khoda,  thanks to God.\"  \\n '),\n",

His second,\" Tariq\\'s mother said, giving her husband an admonishing look.  \\n \\n  Tariq\\'s father blew smoke and winked at Laila. It struck her again that Tariq\\'s parents \\ncould easily pass for his grandparents. His mother hadn\\'t had him until she\\'d been well into \\nher forties.  \\n \\n  \"How is your father, my dear?\" Tariq\\'s mother said, looking on over her bowl As long as \\nLaila had known her, Tariq\\'s mother had worn a wig. It was turn ing a dull purple with age. \\nIt was pulled low on her brow today, and Laila could see the gray hairs of her sideburns . \\nSome days,  it rode high on her forehead. But, to Laila, Tariq\\'s mother never looked pitiable \\nin it  What Laila saw was the calm, self assu red face beneath the wig, the clever eyes, the \\npleasant, unhurried manners.  \\n \\n  \"He\\'s fine,\" Laila said. \"Still at Silo, of course. He\\'s fine.\"  \\n \\n  \"And your mother?\"  \\n \\n  \"Good days. Bad ones too. The same \"  \\n \\n  \"Yes,\" Tariq\\'s mother said thoughtfully, lowerin g her spoon into the bowl \"How hard it \\nmust be, how terribly hard, for a mother to be away from her sons.\"  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re staying for lunch?\" Tariq said  \\n \\n  \"You have to,\" said his mother. \"I\\'m making  shorwa\"  \\n \\n  \"I don\\'t want to be a  mozahem.  \" \\n \\n  \"Imposing?\" Tariq\\'s mother said. \"We leave for a couple of weeks and you turn polite on \\nus?\" \\n \\n  \"All right, I\\'ll stay,\" Laila said, blushing and smiling.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s settled, then.\"  \\n \\n  The truth was, Laila loved eating meals at Tariq\\'s house as much as she disliked eatin g \\nthem at hers. At Tariq\\'s, there was no eating alone; they always ate as a family. Laila liked \\nthe violet plastic drinking glasses they used and the quarter lemon that always floated in the \\nwater pitcher. She liked how they started each meal with a bowl o f fresh yogurt, how they \\nsqueezed sour oranges on everything, even their yogurt, and how they made small, \\nharmless jokes at each other\\'s expense.  \\n \\n  Over meals, conversation always flowed. Though Tariq and his parents were ethnic \\nPashtuns, they spoke Farsi  when Laila was around for her benefit, even though Laila more \\nor less understood their native Pashto, having learned it in school. Babi said that there were \\ntensions between their people the Tajiks, who were a minority, and Tariq\\'s people, the '),\n",

Tajiks have always felt \\nslighted,  Babi had said.  Pashiun kings ruled this co untry for almost two hundred an d fifty \\nyears, Laila, and Tajiks for all of nine months, back in 1929.  \\n \\n  And you,  Laila had asked,  do you feel slighted, Babi?  \\n \\n  Babi had wiped his eyeglasses clean with the hem of his shirt.  To me, it\\'s nonsense   and \\nvery dangerous nonsense at that  all this talk of I\\'m Tajik and you \\'re Pashiun and he\\'s \\nHazara and she\\'s Uzbek. We \\'re all Afghans, and that\\'s all that should matter. But when \\none group rules over the others for so long …There  is contempt. Rivalry. There is. There \\nalways has been.  \\n \\n  Maybe so. But Laila never felt it in Tariq\\'s house, where these matters never even came up. \\nHer time with Ta riq\\'s family always felt natural to Laila, effortless, uncomplicated by \\ndifferences in tribe or language, or by the personal spites and grudges that infected the air at \\nher own home.  \\n \\n  \"How about a game of cards?\" Tariq said.  \\n \\n  \"Yes, go upstairs,\" his mo ther said, swiping disapprovingly at her husband\\'s cloud of \\nsmoke. \"I\\'ll get  the shorwa  going.\"  \\n \\n  They lay on their stomachs in the middle of Tariq\\'s room and took turns dealing for  \\npanjpar.  Pedaling air with his foot, Tariq told her about his trip. The p each saplings he had \\nhelped his uncle plant. A garden snake he had captured.  \\n  This room was where Laila and Tariq did their homework, where they built playing card \\ntowers and drew ridiculous portraits of each other. If it was raining, they leaned on the \\nwindowsill, drinking warm, fizzy orange Fanta, and watched the swollen rain droplets \\ntrickle down the glass.  \\n \\n  \"All right, here\\'s one,\" Laila said, shuffling. \"What goes around the world but stays in a \\ncorner?\"  \\n \\n  \"Wait.\" Tariq pushed himself up and swung his artificial left leg around. Wincing, he lay \\non his side, leaning on his elbow. \"Hand me that pillow.\" He placed it under his leg. \"There. \\nThat\\'s better.\"  \\n \\n  Laila remembered the first time he\\'d shown her his stump. She\\'d been six. With one  finger, \\nshe had poked the taut ,  shiny skin just below his left knee. Her finger had found little hard \\nlumps there, and Tariq had told her they were spurs of bone that sometimes grew after an \\namputation. She\\'d asked him if his stump hurt, and he said it got sore at th e end of the day, \\nwhen it swelled and didn\\'t fit the prosthesis like it was supposed to, like a finger in a \\nthimble.  And sometimes it gets rubbed Especially when it\\'s hot. Then I get rashes and \\nblisters, but my mother has creams that help. It\\'s not so bad.  \\n  Laila had burst into tears.  \\n '),\n",

He\\'d strapped his leg back on.  You asked to see it, you  giryanok,  \\nyou crybaby!

Tell me, who always wins at ch ess?\"  \\n \\n  \"I let you win.\" He laughed. They both knew that wasn\\'t true.  \\n \\n  \"And who failed math? Who do you come to for help with your math homework even \\nthough you\\'re a grade ahead?\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'d be two grades ahead if math didn\\'t bore me.\"  \\n \\n  \"I suppose geogra phy bores you too.\"  \\n \\n  \"How did you know? Now, shut up. So are we going to the zoo or not?\"  \\n \\n  Laila smiled. \"We\\'re going.\"  \\n \\n  \"Good.\"  \\n \\n  \"I missed you.\"  \\n \\n  There was a pause. Then Tariq turned to her with a half grinning, half grimacing look of \\ndistaste. \"What\\'s the  matter  with you?\"  \\n \\n  How many times had she, Hasina, and Giti said those same three words to each other, \\nLaila wondered, said it without hesitation, after only two or three days of not seeing each \\nother? / missed you, Hasina Oh, I missed you too . In Tariq\\'s grimace, Laila learned that boys \\ndiffered from girls in this regard. They didn\\'t make a show of friendship. They felt no urge, \\nno need, for this sort of talk. Laila imagined it had been this way for her brothers too. Boys, \\nLaila came to see, t reated friendship the way they treated the sun: its existence undisputed; \\nits radiance best enjoyed, not beheld directly.  \\n '),\n",

And she thought that maybe the sunburn on his \\ncheeks deepened momentarily.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Laila didn\\'t mean to tell him. She\\'d, in fact, decided that telling him would be a very bad \\nidea. Someone would get hurt, because Tariq wouldn\\'t be able to let it pass. But wh en they \\nwere on the street later, heading down to the  bus stop, she  saw Khadim again, leaning \\nagainst a wall He was surrounded by his friends, thumbs hooked in his belt loops. He \\ngrinned at her defiantly.  \\n  And so she told Tariq. The story spilled out of h er mouth before she could stop it.  \\n  \"He did what?\"  \\n \\n  She told him again.  \\n \\n  He pointed to Khadim. \"Him? He\\'s the one? You\\'re sure?\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m sure.\"  \\n  Tariq clenched his teeth and muttered something to himself in Pashto that Laila didn\\'t \\ncatch. \"You wait h ere,\" he said, in Farsi now.  \\n \\n  \"No, Tariq \"  \\n \\n  He was already crossing the street.  \\n  Khadim was the first to see him. His grin faded, and he pushed himself off the wall. He \\nunhooked his thumbs from the belt loops and made himself more upright, taking on a  self \\nconscious air of menace. The others followed his gaze.  \\n \\n  Laila wished she hadn\\'t said anything. What if they banded together? How many of them \\nwere there ten? eleven? twelve? What if they hurt him?  \\n \\n  Then Tariq stopped a few feet from Khadim and hi s band. There was a moment of \\nconsideration, Laila thought, maybe a change of heart, and, when he bent down, she \\nimagined he would pretend his shoelace had come undone and walk back to her. Then his \\nhands went to work, and she understood.  \\n \\n  The others und erstood too when Tariq straightened up, standing on one leg. When he \\nbegan hopping toward Khadim, then charging him, his unstrapped leg raised high over his \\nshoulder like a sword.  \\n \\n  The boys stepped aside in a hurry. They gave him a clear path to Khadim.  \\n  Then it was all dust and fists and kicks and yelps.  '),\n",

Mammy said she wasn\\'t \\nhungry. On those nights that she was, she made a point of taking  a plate to her room before \\nBabi even came home. She was usually asleep or lying awake in bed by the time Laila and \\nBabi sat down to eat.  \\n \\n  Babi came out of the bathroom, his hair peppered white with flour when he\\'d come home \\nwashed clean now and combed b ack. \\n  \"What are we having, Laila?\"  \\n \\n  \"Leftover  aush  soup.\"  \\n  \"Sounds good,\" he said, folding the towel with which he\\'d dried his hair. \"So what are we \\nworking on tonight?

This was only to keep Laila a step or two ahead of her class, not because he \\ndisapproved of the work assigned by the school the propaganda teaching notwith standing. \\nIn fact, Babi thought that the one thing the communists had done right or at least intended \\nto ironically, was in the field of education, the vocation from which they had fired him. \\nMore specifically, the education of women. The government had sp onsored literacy classes \\nfor all women. Almost two thirds of the students at Kabul University were women now, \\nBabi said, women who were studying law, medicine, engineering.  \\n \\n  Women have always had it hard in this country, Laila, but they\\'re probably more free now, \\nunder the communists, and have more rights than they\\'ve ever had before,  Babi said, \\nalways lowering his voice, aware of how intolerant Mammy was of even remotely positive \\ntalk of the communists.  But it\\'s true,  Babi said,  it\\'s a good time to be a woman in \\nAfghanistan. And you can take advantage of that, Laila Of course, women\\'s freedom    \\nhere, he shook his head ruefully is also one of the reasons people out there took up arms in \\nthe first place.  \\n  By \"out there,\" he didn\\'t mean Kabul, which had alw ays been relatively liberal and \\nprogressive. Here in Kabul, women taught at the university, ran schools, held office in the \\ngovernment  No, Babi meant the tribal areas, especially the Pashtun regions in the south or \\nin the east near the Pakistani border, w here women were rarely seen on the streets and only \\nthen in burqa and accompanied by men. He meant those regions where men who lived by \\nancient tribal laws had rebelled against the communists and their decrees to liberate women, \\nto abolish forced marriage,  to raise the minimum marriage age to sixteen for girls. There, \\nmen saw it as an insult to their centuries old tradition, Babi said, to be told by the \\ngovernment and a godless one at that that their daughters had to leave home, attend school, '),\n",

Go on.\"  \\n \\n  As she moved toward the steps, Laila heard the visitor say to Babi that he had news from \\nPanjshir. Mammy was in the room now too. She had one hand clamped over her mouth, \\nand her eyes were skipping from Babi to the man in the  pakol . \\n  Laila peeked from the top of the stairs. She watched the stranger sit down with her parents. \\nHe leaned toward them. Said a few muted words.

She was tended to by a pair of sniffling women who took turns patting \\nMammy\\'s hand ginge rly, like she was the rarest and most fragile doll in the world. Mammy \\ndid not seem aware of their presence.  \\n  Laila kneeled before her mother and took her hands. \"Mammy.\"  \\n  Mammy\\'s eyes drifted down. She blinked.  \\n  \"We\\'ll take care of her, Laila jan,\" one  of the women said with an air of self importance. \\nLaila had been to funerals before where she had seen women like this, women who relished \\nall things that had to do with death, official consolers who let no one trespass on their self \\nappointed duties.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s under control. You go on now, girl, and do something else. Leave your mother be.\"  \\n \\n  Shooed away, Laila felt useless. She bounced from one room to the next. She puttered \\naround the kitchen for a while.

When she \\npulled back, tears had pooled in her eyes. \"I am so sorry, Laila,\" she sai d.

He apologized and  disappeared \\ninto his study.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  That a fternoon, the men went to a hall in Karteh Seh that Babi had rented for the  fatiha.  \\nThe women came to the house. Laila took her spot beside Mammy, next to the living room \\nentrance where it was customary for the family of the deceased to sit. Mourners removed \\ntheir shoes at the door, nodded at acquaintances as they crossed the room, and sat on \\nfolding chairs arranged along the walls. Laila saw Wajma, the elderly midwife who had \\ndelivered her. She saw Tariq\\'s mothe r too, wearing a black scarf over the wig. She gave \\nLaila a nod and a slow, sad, close lipped smile.  \\n \\n  From a cassette player, a man\\'s nasal voice chanted verses from the Koran. In between, \\nthe women sighed and shifted and sniffled. There were muted cough s, murmurs, and, \\nperiodically, someone let out a theatrical, sorrow drenched sob.  \\n  Rasheed\\'s wife, Mariam, came in. She was wearing a black hijab.  Strands of her hair \\nstrayed from it onto her brow. She took a seat along the wall across from Laila.  \\n \\n  Next to Laila, Mammy kept rocking back and forth. Laila drew Mammy\\'s hand into her \\nlap and cradled it with both of hers, but Mammy did not seem to notice.  \\n \\n  \"Do you want some water, Mammy?\" Laila said in her ear. \"Are you thirsty?\"  \\n  But Mammy said nothing. Sh e did nothing but sway back and forth and stare at the rug \\nwith a remote, spiritless look.  \\n \\n  Now and then, sitting next to Mammy, seeing the drooping, woebegone looks around the \\nroom, the magnitude of the disaster that had struck her family would register  with Laila. \\nThe possibilities denied. The hopes dashed.  \\n  But the feeling didn\\'t last. It was hard to feel,  really  feel, Mammy\\'s loss. Hard to summon \\nsorrow, to grieve the deaths of people Laila had never really thought of as alive in the first \\nplace. Ahm ad and Noor had always been like lore to her. Like characters in a fable. Kings \\nin a history book.  \\n \\n  It was Tariq who was real, flesh and blood. Tariq, who taught her cusswords in Pashto, \\nwho liked salted clover leaves, who frowned and made a low, moaning  sound when he \\nchewed, who had a light pink birthmark just beneath his left collarbone shaped like an \\nupside down mandolin.  \\n \\n  So she sat beside Mammy and dutifully mourned Ahmad and Noor, but, in Laila\\'s heart, \\nher true brother was alive and well.  \\n '),\n",

Chest pains and \\nheadaches, joint aches and night sweats, paralyzing pains in her ears, lumps no one else \\ncould feel. Babi took her to a doctor, who took blood and urine, shot X rays of Mam my\\'s \\nbody, but found no physical illness.  \\n \\n  Mammy lay in bed most days. She wore black. She picked at her hair and gnawed on the \\nmole below her lip. When Mammy was awake, Laila found her staggering through the \\nhouse. She always ended up in Laila\\'s room, a s though she would run into the boys sooner \\nor later if she just kept walking into the room where they had once slept and farted and \\nfought with pillows. But all she ran into was their absence. And Laila. Which, Laila \\nbelieved, had become one and the same to Mammy.  \\n \\n  The only task Mammy never neglected was her five daily  namaz  prayers. She ended each  \\nnamaz  with her head hung low, hands held before her face, palms up, muttering a prayer for \\nGod to bring victory to the Mujahideen. Laila had to shoulder more and more of the chores. \\nIf she didn\\'t tend to the house, she was apt to find clothes, shoes, open rice bags, cans of \\nbeans, and dirty dishes strewn about everywhere. Laila washed Mammy\\'s dresses and \\nchanged her sheets. She coaxed her out of bed for baths a nd meals. She was the one who \\nironed Babi\\'s shirts and folded his pants. Increasingly, she was the cook.  \\n \\n  Sometimes, after she was done with her chores, Laila crawled into bed next to Mammy. \\nShe wrapped her arms around her, laced her fingers with her mot her\\'s, buried her face in \\nher hair. Mammy would stir, murmur something. Inevitably, she would start in on a story \\nabout the boys.  \\n \\n  One day, as they were lying this way, Mammy said, \"Ahmad was going to be a leader. He \\nhad the charisma for it People three times his age listened to him with respect, Laila. It was \\nsomething to see. And Noon Oh, my Noor. He was always making sketches of building  \\nsand bridges. He was going to be an architect, you know. He was going to transform Kabul \\nwith his designs. And now t hey\\'re both  shaheed,  my boys, both martyrs.\"  \\n \\n  Laila lay there and listened, wishing Mammy would notice that  she, Laila, hadn\\'t become  \\nshaheed,  that she was alive, here, in bed with her, that she had hopes and a future. But Laila \\nknew that her future was no match for her brothers\\' past. They had overshadowed her in life. \\nThey would obliterate her in death. Mammy was now the curator of their lives\\' museum \\nand she, Laila, a mere visitor. A receptacle for their myths. The  parchment on which \\nMammy meant to ink  their legends.  \\n \\n  \"The messenger who came with the news, he said that when they brought the boys back to \\ncamp, Ahmad Shah Massoud personally oversaw the burial.

Laila shifted, rested her head on Mammy\\'s chest.  \\n  \"Some days,\" Mammy said in a hoarse voice, \"I listen to that clo ck ticking in the hallway. \\nThen I think of all the ticks, all the minutes, all the hours and days and weeks and months \\nand years waiting for me.

So  weak I just want to collapse somewhere.\"  \\n \\n  \"I wish there was something I could do,\" Laila said, meaning it. But it came out sounding \\nbroad, perfunctory, like the token consolation of a kind stranger.  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re a good daughter,\" Mammy said, after a deep sigh. \"And I haven\\'t been much of a \\nmother to you.\"  \\n \\n  \"Don\\'t say that.\"  \\n \\n  \"Oh, it\\'s true. I know it and I\\'m sorry for it, my love.\"  \\n \\n  \"Mammy?\"  \\n \\n  \"Mm.\"  \\n \\n  Laila sat up, looking down at Mammy. There were gray strands in Mammy\\'s hair now. \\nAnd it startled Laila how  much  weight Mammy, who\\'d always been plump, had lost. Her \\ncheeks had a sallow, drawn look. The blouse  she was wearing drooped over her shoulders, \\nand there was a gaping space between her neck and the collar. More than once Laila had \\nseen the wedd ing band  slide off  Mammy\\'s finger.  \\n \\n  \"I\\'ve been meaning to ask you something.\"  \\n \\n  \"What is it?\"  \\n \\n  \"You wouldn\\'t…\" Laila began.  \\n \\n  She\\'d talked about it to Hasina. At Hasina\\'s suggestion, the two of them had emptied the \\nbottle of aspirin in the gutter, hi dden the kitchen knives and the sharp kebab skewers \\nbeneath the rug under the couch. Hasina had found a rope in the yard. When Babi couldn\\'t \\nfind his razors, Laila had to tell him of her fears. He dropped on the edge of the couch, \\nhands between his knees. Laila waited for some kind of reassurance from him. But all she \\ngot was a bewildered, hollow eyed look.  \\n  \"You wouldn\\'t…Mammy I worry that \"  \\n  \"I thought about it the night we got the news,\" Mammy said. \"I won\\'t lie to you, I\\'ve \\nthought about it since too.

The driver merged back onto the road  \\n \\n  \"How much farther?\" Laila asked  \\n \\n  \"An hour at the most,\" the driver said. \"Barring any more convoys or checkpoints.\"  \\n  They were taking a day trip, Laila , Babi, and Tariq. Hasina had wanted to come too, had \\nbegged her father, but he wouldn\\'t allow it. The trip was Babi\\'s idea. Though he could \\nhardly afford it on his salary, he\\'d hired a driver for the day. He wouldn\\'t disclose anything \\nto Laila about their  destination except to say that, with it, he was contributing to her \\neducation.  \\n \\n  They had been on the road since five in the morning. Through Laila\\'s window, the \\nlandscape shifted from snowcapped peaks to deserts to canyons and sun scorched \\noutcroppings of rocks. Along the way, they passed mud houses with thatched roofs and \\nfields dotted with bundles of wheat. Pitched out in the dusty fields, here and there, Laila \\nrecognized the black tents of Koochi nomads. And, frequently, the carcasses of burned out \\nSoviet tanks and wrecked helicopters. This, she thought, was Ahmad and Noor\\'s \\nAfghanistan. This, here in the provinces, was where the war was being fought, after all. Not \\nin Kabul. Kabul was largely at peace. Back in Kabul, if not for the occasional bursts o f \\ngunfire, if not for the Soviet soldiers smoking on the sidewalks and the Soviet jeeps always \\nbumping through the streets, war might as well have been a rumor.  \\n  It was late morning, after they\\'d passed two more checkpoints, when they entered a valley. \\nBabi had Laila lean across the seat and pointed to a series of ancient looking walls of sun \\ndried red in the distance.  \\n \\n  \"That\\'s called Shahr -e-Zohak. The Red City. It used to be a fortress. It was built some nine \\nhundred years ago to defend the valley from  invaders.

It was Genghis Khan himself who then \\ndestroyed it.\"  \\n \\n  \"And that, my young friends, is the story of our country, one invader after another,\" the \\ndriver said, flick ing cigarette ash out the window. \"Macedonians. Sassanians. Arabs. \\nMongols. Now the Soviets. But we\\'re like those walls up there. Battered, and nothing pretty \\nto look at, but still standing.

Babi pointed \"There they are. Look.\"  \\n  Tariq gasped. Laila did too. And she knew then that she could live to be a  hundred and she \\nwould never again see a thing as magnificent.  \\n \\n  The two Buddhas were enormous, soaring much higher than she had imagined from all the \\nphotos she\\'d seen of them. Chiseled into a sun bleached rock cliff, they peered down at \\nthem, as they ha d nearly two thousand years before, Laila imagined, at caravans crossing \\nthe valley on the Silk Road. On either side of them, along the overhanging niche, the cliff \\nwas pocked with myriad caves.  \\n \\n  \"I feel so small,\" Tariq said.  \\n \\n  \"You want to climb up?\" Babi said.  \\n  \"Up the statues?\" Laila asked. \"We can do that?\"  \\n \\n  Babi smiled and held out his hand. \"Come on.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The climb was  hard for Tariq, who had to hold on to both Laila and Babi as they inched \\nup a winding, narrow, dimly lit staircase. They saw shadowy caves along the way, and \\ntunnels honeycombing the cliff every which way.  \\n  \"Careful where you step,\" Babi said His voice made a loud echo. \"The ground is \\ntreacherous.\"  \\n \\n  In some parts, the staircase was open to the Buddha\\'s cavity.  \\n \\n  \"Don\\'t l ook down, children. Keep looking straight ahead.\"  \\n \\n  As they climbed, Babi told them that Bamiyan had once been a thriving Buddhist center \\nuntil it had fallen under Islamic Arab rule in the ninth century. The sandstone cliffs were \\nhome to Buddhist monks wh o carved caves in them to use as living quarters and as \\nsanctuary for weary traveling pilgrims. The monks, Babi said, painted beautiful frescoes \\nalong the walls and roofs of their caves.  \\n \\n  \"At one point,\" he said, \"there were five thousand monks living as  hermits in these caves.\"  \\n \\n  Tariq was badly out of breath when they reached the top.

Babi  said they were \\ngreen winter wheat and alfalfa, potatoes too. The fields were bordered by poplars and \\ncrisscrossed by streams and irrigation ditches, on the banks of which tiny female figures \\nsquatted and washed clothes. Babi pointed to rice paddies and ba rley fields draping the \\nslopes. It was autumn, and Laila could make out people in bright tunics on the roofs of mud \\nbrick dwellings laying out the harvest to dry. The main road going through the town was \\npoplar lined too. There were small shops and teahous es and street side barbers on either \\nside of it. Beyond the village, beyond the river and the streams, Laila saw foothills, bare \\nand dusty brown, and, beyond those, as beyond everything else in Afghanistan, the \\nsnowcapped Hindu Kush.  \\n \\n  The sky above all o f this was an immaculate, spotless blue.  \\n  \"It\\'s so quiet,\" Laila breathed. She could see tiny sheep and horses but couldn\\'t hear their \\nbleating and whinnying.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s what I always remember about being up here,\" Babi said. \"The silence. The peace of \\nit. I wanted you to experience it. But I also wanted you to see your country\\'s heritage, \\nchildren, to learn of its rich past. You see, some things I can teach you. Some you learn \\nfrom books. But there are things that, well, you just have to see andfeel.\"  \\n \\n  \"Look,\" said Tariq.  \\n \\n  They watched a hawk, gliding in circles above the village.  \\n \\n  \"Did you ever bring Mammy up here?\" Laila asked  \\n \\n  \"Oh, many times. Before the boys were born. After too. Your mother, she used to be \\nadventurous then, and…so  alive.  She was just about the liveliest, happiest person I\\'d ever \\nmet.\" He smiled at the memory. \"She had this laugh. I swear it\\'s why I married her, Laila, \\nfor that laugh. It bulldozed you. You stood no chance against it.\"  \\n \\n  A wave of affection overcame Laila. From the n on, she would always remember Babi this \\nway: reminiscing about Mammy, with his elbows on the rock, hands cupping his chin, his \\nhair ruffled by the wind, eyes crinkled against the sun.  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m going to look at some of those caves,\" Tariq said.  \\n '),\n",

Around \\nthem, the trees had started to turn, ochre and orange, scarlet red.  \\n \\n  \"I miss the boys too, you know ,\" Babi said. His eyes had welled up a tad. His chin was \\ntrembling. \"I may not… With your mother, both her joy and sadness are extreme. She can\\'t \\nhide either. She never could. Me, I suppose I\\'m different.

He took a long, \\ndeep b reath, looked at her. \"But I\\'m glad I have you. Every day, I thank God for you. Every \\nsingle day.

He seemed slightly \\nstartled unlike Mammy, he rarely expressed his affection physically. He planted a brisk kiss \\non the top of her head and hugged her back awkwardly. They stood this way for a while, \\nlooking down on the Bamiyan Valley.  \\n \\n  \"As much as I love this land, some days I think about leaving it,\" Babi said.  \\n \\n  \"Where  to?\" \\n \\n  \"Anyplace where it\\'s easy to forget.

Somewhere near the sea. Like \\nCalifornia.\"  \\n \\n  Babi said the Americans were a generous people. They would help them with money and \\nfood for a while, until they could get on their feet.  \\n \\n  \"I would find work, and, in a few  years, when we had enough saved up, we\\'d open a little \\nAfghan restaurant Nothing fancy, mind you, just a modest little place, a few tables, some \\nrugs.

It would turn into a gathering place for other Afghans who, like them, \\nhad fled the war.

They both did. They knew that Mammy \\nwasn't going anywhere. Leaving Afghanistan had been unthinkable to her while Ahmad and \\nNoor were still alive. Now that they were  shaheed,  packing up and running was an even \\nworse affront, a betrayal, a dis avowal of the sacrifice her sons had made.  \\n \\n  How can you think of it?

No. Never.  \\n \\n  And Babi would never leave without her, Laila knew, even though Mammy was no more \\na wife to him now than she was a mother to Laila. For Mammy, he would brush aside this \\ndaydream of his the way he flicked specks of flour from his coat when he got home from \\nwork. And so they would stay. They would stay until the war ended And they would stay \\nfor whatever came after war.  \\n  Laila remembered Mammy telling Babi once that she had married a man who had no \\nconvictions. Mammy didn't understand. She didn't understand tha t if she looked into a \\nmirror, she would find the one unfailing conviction of his life looking right back at her.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Later, after they'd eaten a lunch of boiled eggs and potatoes with bread, Tariq napped \\nbeneath a tree on the banks of a gurgling str eam. He slept with his coat neatly folded into a \\npillow, his hands crossed on his chest. The driver went to the village to buy almonds. Babi \\nsat at the foot of a thick trunked acacia tree reading a paperback. Laila knew the book; he'd \\nread it to her once. It told the story of an old fisherman named Santiago who catches an \\nenormous fish. But by the time he sails his boat to safety, there is nothing left of his prize \\nfish; the sharks have torn it to pieces.  \\n \\n  Laila sat on the edge of the stream, dipping her feet into the cool water. Overhead, \\nmosquitoes hummed and cottonwood seeds danced. A dragonfly whirred nearby. Laila \\nwatched its wings catch glints of sunlight as it buzzed from one blade of grass to another. \\nThey flashed purple, then green, orange. Across  the stream, a group of local Hazara boys \\nwere picking patties of dried cow dung from the ground and stowing them into burlap sacks \\ntethered to their backs. Somewhere, a donkey brayed. A generator sputtered to life.  \\n \\n  Laila thought again about Babi's litt le dream.  Somewhere near the sea  \\n  There was something she hadn't told Babi up there atop the Buddha: that, in one important \\nway, she was glad they couldn't go. She would miss Giti and her pinch faced earnestness, \\nyes, and Hasina too, with her wicked laugh  and reckless clowning around But, mostly, \\nLaila remembered all too well the inescapable drudgery of those four weeks without Tariq \"),\n",

She remembered all too well how time had dragged without \\nhim, how she had shuffled about feeling  waylaid, out of balance. How could she ever cope \\nwith his permanent absence?  \\n \\n  Maybe it was senseless to want to be near a person so badly here in a country where \\nbullets had shredded her own brothers to pieces.

They stood in muddy snow and watched the line of tanks, armored \\ntrucks, and jeeps as light snow flew across the glare of the passing headlights. There were \\nheckles and jeers. Afgh an soldiers kept people off the street. Every now and then, they had \\nto fire a warning shot.  \\n \\n  Mammy hoisted a photo of Ahmad and Noor high over her head. It was the one of them \\nsitting back to back under the pear tree. There were others like her, women w ith pictures of \\ntheir shaheed  husbands, sons, brothers held high.  \\n  Someone tapped Laila and Hasina on the shoulder. It was Tariq.  \\n \\n  \"Where did you get that thing?\" Hasina exclaimed.  \\n \\n  \"I thought I\\'d come dressed for the occasion.\" Tariq said. He was wea ring an enormous \\nRussian fur hat, complete with earflaps, which he had pulled down.  \\n \\n  \"How do I look?\"  \\n \\n  \"Ridiculous,\" Laila laughed.  \\n \\n  \"That\\'s the idea.\"  \\n \\n  \"Your parents came here with you dressed like this?\"  \\n  \"They\\'re home, actually,\" he said.  \\n \\n  The previous fall, Tariq\\'s uncle in Ghazni had died of a heart attack, and, a few weeks \\nlater, Tariq\\'s father had suffered a heart attack of his own, leaving him frail and tired, prone \\nto anxiety and bouts of depression that overtook him for weeks at a time.  Laila was glad to \\nsee Tariq like this, like his old self again. For weeks after his father\\'s illness, Laila had \\nwatched him moping around, heavy faced and sullen.  \\n  The three of them stole away while Mammy and Babi stood watching the Soviets. From a \\nstree t vendor, Tariq bought them each a plate of boiled beans topped with thick cilantro \\nchutney. They ate beneath the awning of a closed rug shop, then Hasina went to find her \\nfamily.  \\n \\n  On the bus ride home, Tariq and Laila sat behind her parents. Mammy was b y the window, \\nstaring out, clutching the picture against her chest.

They\\'l l keep the war going through him, you can bet on that.\"  \\n  Someone in the next aisle voiced his agreement.  \\n \\n  Mammy was muttering to herself, long winded prayers that rolled on and on until she had \\nno breath left and had to eke out the last few words in a t iny, high pitched squeak.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  They \"went to Cinema Park later that day, Laila and Tariq, and had to settle for a Soviet \\nfilm that was dubbed, to unintentionally comic effect, in Farsi. There was a merchant ship, \\nand a first mate in love with the capt ain\\'s daughter. Her name was Alyona. Then came a \\nfierce storm, lightning, rain, the heaving sea tossing the ship. One of the frantic sailors \\nyelled something. An absurdly calm Afghan voice translated: \"My dear sir, would you \\nkindly pass the rope?\"  \\n \\n  At th is, Tariq burst out cackling. And, soon, they both were in the grips of a hopeless \\nattack of laughter. Just when one became fatigued, the other would snort, and off they \\nwould go on another round. A man sitting two rows up turned around and shushed them.  \\n \\n  There was a wedding scene near the end. The captain had relented and let Alyona marry \\nthe first mate. The newlyweds were smiling at each other. Everyone was drinking vodka.  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m never getting married,\" Tariq whispered.  \\n \\n  \"Me neither,\" said Laila, but  not before a moment of nervous hesitation. She worried that \\nher voice had betrayed her disappointment at what he had said.

Me, the bride, and the guy holding the gun to my head.\"  \\n \\n  The man in the front row gave  them another admonishing look.  \\n  On the screen, Alyona and her new husband locked lips.  \\n  Watching the kiss, Laila felt strangely conspicuous all at once. She became intensely \\naware of her heart thumping, of the blood thudding in her ears, of the shape of  Tariq beside \\nher, tightening up, becoming still. The kiss dragged on. It seemed of utmost urgency to \\nLaila, suddenly, that she not stir or make a noise. She sensed that Tariq was observing her \\none eye on the kiss, the other on her as she was observing him.

The morning that they took her, Laila and Giti went to \\nHasina\\'s house to say good bye. Hasina told them that the cousin, her husband to  be, had \\nalready started the process to move them to Germany, where his brothers lived. Within the \\nyear, she thought, they would be in Frankfurt. They cried then in a three way embrace. Giti \\nwas inconsolable.

The intense, surly Gulbuddin \\nHekmatyar, leader of the Hezb -e-Islami faction, a Pashtun who had studied engineering and \\nonce  killed a Maoist student. Rabbani, Tajik leader of the Jamiat -e-Islami faction, who had \\ntaught Islam at Kabul University in the days of the monarchy.

Mammy had nailed up a poster of \\nhim in her room. Massoud\\'s handsome, thoughtful face, eyebrow cocked and trademark  \\npakol  tilted, would become ubiquitous in Kabul. His soulful black eyes would gaze back \\nfrom billboards, walls, sto refront windows, from little flags mounted on the antennas of \\ntaxicabs.  \\n \\n  For Mammy, this was the day she had longed for. This brought to fruition all those years \\nof waiting.  \\n \\n  At last, she could end her vigils, and her sons could rest in peace.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The day after Najibullah surrendered, Mammy rose from bed a new woman. For the first \\ntime in the five years since Ahmad and Noor had become shaheed, she didn\\'t wear black. \\nShe put on a cobalt blue linen dress with white polka dots. She washed the windows, swept \\nthe floor, aired the house, took a long bath.

And she knew, \\neven before a cloud passed over Mammy\\'s face and her features darkened, that she\\'d made \\na mistake.  \\n \\n  \"That  he is not,\" Mammy said flatly. \"You will not liken that one legged carpenter\\'s boy to \\nyour brother s. There is  no one  like your brothers.\"  \\n \\n  \"I didn\\'t say he…That\\'s not how I meant it.\"  \\n \\n  Mammy sighed through the nose and clenched her teeth.  \\n \\n  \"Anyway,\" she resumed, but without the coy lightheadedness of a few moments ago, \\n\"what I\\'m trying to say is that if you\\'re not careful, people will talk.\"  \\n \\n  Laila opened her mouth to say something. It wasn\\'t that Mammy didn\\'t have a point. Laila \\nknew that the days of innocent, unhindered frolicking in the streets with Tariq had passed. \\nFor some time now, Laila had begun to sense a new strangeness when the two of them were \\nout in public. An awareness of being looked at, scrutinized, whispered about, that Laila had \\nnever felt before. And  wouldn\\'t  have felt even now but for one fundamental fact: She had \\nfallen for Tariq. Hopelessly and desperately. When he was near, she couldn\\'t help but be \\nconsumed with the most scandalous thoughts, of his lean, bare body entangled with hers. \\nLying in bed at night, she pictured him kissing her belly, wondered at the softness of his  \\nlips, at the feel of his hands on her neck, her chest, her back, and lower still. When she \\nthought of him this way, she was overtaken with guilt, but also with a peculiar, warm \\nsensation that spread upward from her belly until it felt as if her face were glowing pink.  \\n \\n  No. Mammy had a point. More than she knew, in fact. Laila suspected that some, if not \\nmost, of the neighbors were already gossiping about her and Tariq. Laila had noticed the \\nsly grins, was aware of the whispers in the neighborhood that th e two of them were a \\ncouple. The other day, for instance, she and Tariq were walking up the street together when \\nthey\\'d passed Rasheed, the shoemaker, with his burqa clad wife, Mariam, in tow. As he\\'d \\npassed by them, Rasheed had playfully said, \"If it isn\\' t Laili and Majnoon,\" referring to the \\nstar crossed lovers of Nezami\\'s popular twelfth century romantic poem a Farsi version of  \\nRomeo and Juliet,  Babi said, though he added that  Nezami had written his tale of ill fated \\nlovers four centuries before Shakespe are. \\n \\n  Mammy had a point.  \\n  What rankled Laila was that Mammy hadn\\'t earned the right to make it. It would have \\nbeen one thing if Babi had raised this issue. But Mammy? All those years of aloofness, of \\ncooping herself up and not caring where Laila went an d whom she saw and what she \\nthought…It was unfair. Laila felt like she was no better than these pots and pans, something \\nthat could go neglected, then laid claim to, at will, whenever the mood struck.  \\n \\n  But this was a big day, an important day, for all of  them. It would be petty to spoil it over \\nthis. In the spirit of things, Laila let it pass.  \\n  \"I get your point,\" she said.  '),\n",

Now, where is Hakim? Where, oh where, is \\nthat sweet little husband of mine?\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  It was a dazzling, cloudless day, perfect for a party. The men sat on rickety folding chairs \\nin the yard. They drank tea and smoked and talked in loud bantering voices about the \\nMujahideen\\'s plan. From Babi, Laila had learned the outline of it: Afghanista n was now \\ncalled the Islamic State of Afghanistan. An Islamic Jihad Council, formed in Peshawar by \\nseveral of the Mujahideen factions, would oversee things for two months, led by \\nSibghatullah Mojadidi. This would be followed then by a leadership council le d by Rabbani, \\nwho would take over for four months. During those six months, a loyajirga  would be held, a \\ngrand council of leaders and elders, who would form an interim government to hold power \\nfor two years, leading up to democratic elections.  \\n  One of the men was fanning skewers of lamb sizzling over a makeshift grill Babi and \\nTariq\\'s father were playing a game of chess in the shade of the old pear tree. Their faces \\nwere scrunched up in concentration. Tariq was sitting at the board too, in turns watching \\nthe match, then listening in on the political chat at the adjacent table.  \\n \\n  The women gathered in the living room, the hallway, and the kitchen. They chatted as \\nthey hoisted their babies and expertly dodged, with minute shifts of their hips, the children \\ntearing after each other around the house. An Ustad Sarahang  ghazal  blared from a cassette \\nplayer.  \\n \\n  Laila was in the kitchen, making carafes of  dogh  with Giti. Giti was no longer as shy, or \\nas serious, as before. For several months now, the perpetual sever e scowl had cleared from \\nher brow. She laughed openly these days, more frequently, and it struck Laila a bit \\nflirtatiously. She had done away with the drab ponytails, let her hair grow, and streaked it \\nwith red highlights. Laila learned eventually that the  impetus for this transformation was an \\neighteen year old boy whose attention Giti had caught. His name was Sabir, and he was a \\ngoalkeeper on Giti\\'s older brother\\'s soccer team.  \\n \\n  \"Oh, he has the most handsome smile, and this thick, thick black hair!\" Git i had told Laila. \\nNo one knew about their attraction, of course. Giti had secretly met him twice for tea, \\nfifteen minutes each time, at a small teahouse on the other side of town, in Taimani.  \\n \\n  \"He\\'s going to ask for my hand, Laila! Maybe as early as this  summer. Can you believe it? \\nI swear I can\\'t stop thinking about him.\"  \\n \\n  \"What about school?\" Laila had asked. Giti had tilted her head and given her a We both \\nknow better  look.  \\n \\n  By the time we\\'re twenty,  Hasina used to say,  Giti and I, we\\'ll have pushed  out four, five \\nkids each Bui you, Laila, you \\'1Imake m two dummies proud.

He said a prayer at their grave. It\\'ll be a token of \\nthanks for his decency.\" Mammy cracked another boiled egg. \"I hear he\\'s a reflective, \\nhonorable man. I think he would app reciate it.\"  \\n \\n  All around them, women bolted in and out of the kitchen, carried out bowls of  qurma,  \\nplatters of  masiawa,  loaves of bread, and arranged it all on  the sofrah  spread on the living \\nroom floor.  \\n \\n  Every once in a while, Tariq sauntered in. He p icked at this, nibbled on that.  \\n  \"No men allowed,\" said Giti.  \\n \\n  \"Out, out, out,\" cried Wajma.  \\n \\n  Tariq smiled at the women\\'s good humored shooing. He seemed to take pleasure in not \\nbeing welcome here, in infecting this female atmosphere with his half gri nning, masculine \\nirreverence.  \\n  Laila did her best not to look at him, not to give these women any more gossip fodder than \\nthey already had So she kept her eyes down and said nothing to him, but she remembered a \\ndream she\\'d had a few nights before, of his face and hers, together in a mirror, beneath a \\nsoft, green veil. And grains of rice, dropping from his hair, bouncing off the glass with a  \\nlink. \\n \\n  Tariq reached to sample a morsel of veal cooked with potatoes.  \\n \\n  \"Ho bacha!\"  Giti slapped the back of his h and. Tariq stole it anyway and laughed.  \\n  He stood almost a foot taller than Laila now. He shaved. His face was leaner, more \\nangular. His shoulders had broadened. Tariq liked to wear pleated trousers, black shiny \\nloafers, and short sleeve shirts that showe d off his newly muscular arms compliments of an \\nold, rusty set of barbells that he lifted daily in his yard. His face had lately adopted an \\nexpression of playful contentiousness. He had taken to a self conscious cocking of his head \\nwhen he spoke, slightly to the side, and to arching one eyebrow when he laughed. He let his \\nhair grow and had fallen into the habit of tossing the floppy locks often and unnecessarily. \\nThe corrupt half grin was a new thing too.  \\n \\n  The last time Tariq was shooed out of the kitchen , his mother caught Laila stealing a \\nglance at him. Laila\\'s heart jumped, and her eyes fluttered guiltily.

Once they had \\ntaken their share, the women and children settled on the floor around the  sofrah  and ate.  \\n \\n  It was after  fat sofrah  was cl eared and the plates were stacked in the kitchen, when the \\nfrenzy of tea making and remembering who took green and who black started, that Tariq \\nmotioned with his head and slipped out the door.  \\n  Laila waited five minutes, then followed.  \\n \\n  She found him t hree houses down the street, leaning against the wall at the entrance of a \\nnarrow mouthed alley between two adjacent houses. He was humming an old Pashto song, \\nby Ustad Awal Mir:  \\n \\n  Da ze ma ziba waian, da ze ma dada waian. This is our beautiful land, this  is our beloved \\nland.  \\n \\n  And he was smoking, another new habit, which he\\'d picked up from the guys Laila spotted \\nhim hanging around with these days. Laila couldn\\'t stand them, these new friends of Tariq\\'s. \\nThey all dressed the same way, pleated trousers, a nd tight shirts that accentuated their arms \\nand chest. They all wore too much cologne, and they all smoked. They strutted around the \\nneighborhood in groups, joking, laughing loudly, sometimes even calling after girls, with \\nidentical stupid, self satisfied grins on their faces. One of Tariq\\'s friends, on the basis of the \\nmost passing of resemblances to Sylvester Stallone, insisted he be called Rambo.  \\n  \"Your mother would kill you if she knew about your smoking,\" Laila said, looking one \\nway, then the other, b efore slipping into the alley.  \\n \\n  \"But she doesn\\'t,\" he said. He moved aside to make room.  \\n \\n  \"That could change.\"  \\n \\n  \"Who is going to tell? You?\"  \\n \\n  Laila tapped her foot. \"Tell your secret to the wind, but don\\'t blame it for telling the trees.\"  \\n \\n  Tariq smiled, the one eyebrow arched. \"Who said that?\"  \\n \\n  \"Khalil Gibran.\"  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re a show off.\"  \\n \\n  \"Give me a cigarette.\"  \\n \\n  He shook his head no and crossed his arms. This was a new entry in his repertoire of poses: \\nback to the wall, arms crossed, cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, his good \\nleg casually bent.  \\n  \"Why not?\"  \\n '),\n",

Loud voices. Screaming.  \\n \\n  Laila took off running. Tariq hobbled behind her.  \\n  There was a melee in the yard. In the middle of it were two snarling men, rolling on the \\nground, a knife between them. Laila recognized one of them as a man from the table who \\nhad been discussing politics earlier. The other was the man who had been fanning the \\nkebab skewers. Several men were trying to pull them apart. Babi wasn\\'t among them. He \\nstood by the wall, at a safe distance from the fight , with Tariq\\'s father, who was crying.  \\n  From the excited voices around her, Laila caught snippets that she put together: The \\nfellow at the politics table, a Pashtun, had called Ahmad Shah Massoud a traitor for \\n\"making a deal\" with the Soviets in the 1980s . The kebab man, a Tajik, had taken offense \\nand demanded a retraction. The Pashtun had refused. The Tajik had said that if not for \\nMassoud, the other man\\'s sister would still be \"giving it\" to Soviet soldiers. They had come \\nto blows. One of them had then b randished a knife; there was disagreement as to who.  \\n \\n  With horror, Laila saw that Tariq had thrown himself into the scuffle. She also saw that \\nsome of the peacemakers were now throwing punches of their own. She thought she spotted \\na second knife.  \\n \\n  Later that evening, Laila thought of how the melee had toppled over, with men falling on \\ntop of one another, amid yelps and cries and shouts and flying punches, and, in the middle \\nof it, a grimacing Tariq, his hair disheveled, his leg come undone, trying to cr awl out.  \\n '),\n",

The brief and interminable time of feeling suspended. The not knowing. \\nThe waiting. Like a defendant about to hear the verdict.  \\n \\n  Often it happened at dinner, when she and Babi were at the table. When it started, their \\nheads snapped up. They listened to the whistling, forks in midair, unchewed food in their \\nmouths. Laila saw the reflection of their half lit faces in the pitch black wind ow, their \\nshadows unmoving on the wall. The whistling. Then the blast, blissfully elsewhere, \\nfollowed by an expulsion of breath and the knowledge that they had been spared for now \\nwhile somewhere else, amid cries and choking clouds of smoke, there was a sc rambling, a \\nbarehanded frenzy of digging, of pulling from the debris, what remained of a sister, a \\nbrother, a grandchild.  \\n \\n  But the flip side of being spared was the agony of wondering who hadn\\'t. After every \\nrocket blast, Laila raced to the street, stamm ering a prayer, certain that, this time, surely \\nthis time, it was Tariq they would find buried beneath the rubble and smoke.  \\n \\n  At night, Laila lay in bed and watched the sudden white flashes reflected in her window. \\nShe listened to the rattling of automat ic gunfire and counted the rockets whining overhead \\nas the house shook and flakes of plaster rained down on her from the ceiling. Some nights, \\nwhen the light of rocket fire was so bright a person could read a book by it, sleep never \\ncame. And, if it did, L aila\\'s dreams were suffused with fire and detached limbs and the \\nmoaning of the wounded.  \\n  Morning brought no relief. The muezzin\\'s call for  namaz  rang out, and the Mujahideen set \\ndown their guns, faced west, and prayed.

He heard the word of mouth and passed it on to her. \\nTariq was the one who told her, for instance, that militiamen stationed in the mountains \\nsharpened their marksmanship and settled wagers over sa id marksmanship by shooting \\ncivilians down below, men, women, children, chosen at random. He told her that they fired \\nrockets at cars but, for some reason, left taxis alone which explained to Laila the recent rash \\nof people spraying their cars yellow.  \\n \\n  Tariq explained to her the treacherous, shifting boundaries within Kabul. Laila learned \\nfrom him, for instance, that this road, up to the second acacia tree on the left, belonged to \\none warlord; that the next four blocks, ending with the bakery shop next to  the demolished \\npharmacy, was another warlord\\'s sector; and that if she crossed that street and walked half a \\nmile west, she would find herself in the territory of yet another warlord and, therefore, fair \\ngame for sniper fire. And this was what Mammy\\'s her oes were called now. Warlords. Laila \\nheard them called  iofangdar  too. Riflemen. Others still called them Mujahideen, but, when \\nthey did, they made a face a sneering, distasteful face the word reeking of deep aversion \\nand deep scorn. Like an insult.  \\n \\n  Tariq snapped the magazine back into his handgun. \" Do you have it in  you?\" Laila \\nsaid.\"To what?\"  \\n \\n  \"To use this thing. To kill with it.\"  \\n \\n  Tariq tucked the gun into the waist of his denims.

When Tariq\\'s fingers \\ntentatively began to slip into hers, Laila let them. And when suddenly he leaned over and \\npressed his lips to hers, she let him again . \\n \\n  At that moment, all of Mammy\\'s talk of reputations and mynah birds sounded immaterial \\nto Laila.

The shelling knocked \\ndown power lines, pulverized entire blocks of shops and homes. Laila heard that Pashtun \\nmilitiamen were attacking Hazara  households, breaking in and shooting entire families, \\nexecution style, and that Hazaras were retaliating by abducting Pashtun civilians, raping \\nPashtun girls, shelling Pashtun neighborhoods, and killing indiscriminately. Every day, \\nbodies were found tied to trees, sometimes burned beyond recognition. Often, they\\'d been \\nshot in the head, had had their eyes gouged out, their tongues cut out.  \\n  Babi tried again to convince Mammy to leave Kabul.  \\n \\n  \"They\\'ll work it out,\" Mammy said. \"This fighting is temporary . They\\'ll sit down and \\nfigure something out.\"  \\n \\n  \"Fariba, all these people  know  is war,\" said Babi. \"They learned to walk with a milk bottle \\nin one hand and a gun in the other.\"  \\n \\n  \"Who  are you to say?\" Mammy shot back. \"Did you fight jihad? Did you abando n \\neverything you had and risk your life? If not for the Mujahideen, we\\'d still be the Soviets\\' \\nservants, remember. And now you\\'d have us betray them!\"  \\n  \"We aren\\'t the ones doing the betraying, Fariba.\"  \\n  \"You go, then. Take your daughter and run away. Sen d me a postcard. But peace is \\ncoming, and I, for one, am going to wait for it.\"  \\n  The streets became so unsafe that Babi did an unthinkable thing: He had Laila drop out of \\nschool.  \\n \\n  He took over the teaching duties himself. Laila went into his study every  day after \\nsundown, and, as Hekmatyar launched his rockets at Massoud from the southern outskirts \\nof the city, Babi and she discussed  the ghazals  of Hafez and the works of the beloved \\nAfghan poet Ustad Khalilullah Khalili. Babi taught her to derive the qua dratic equation, \\nshowed her how to factor polynomials and plot parametric curves. When he was teaching, \\nBabi was transformed. In his element, amid his books, he looked taller to Laila. His voice \\nseemed to rise from a calmer, deeper place, and he didn\\'t bli nk nearly as much. Laila \\npictured him as he must have been once, erasing his blackboard with graceful swipes, \\nlooking over a student\\'s shoulder, fatherly and attentive.  \\n  But it wasn\\'t easy to pay attention. Laila kept getting distracted.  \\n  \"What is the ar ea of a pyramid?\" Babi would ask, and all Laila could think of was the \\nfullness of Tariq\\'s lips, the heat of his breath on her mouth, her own reflection in his hazel \\neyes. She\\'d kissed him twice more since the time beneath the tree, longer, more \\npassionate ly, and, she thought, less clumsily. Both times, she\\'d met him secretly in the dim \\nalley where he\\'d smoked a cigarette the day of Mammy\\'s lunch party. The second time, \\nshe\\'d let him touch her breast.  '),\n",

Only three blocks from Giti\\'s house, a stray rocket struck the girls.

She couldn\\'t get around the unfathomable reality that  Giti wasn\\'t alive anymore. \\nGiti, with whom Laila had exchanged secret notes in class, whose fingernails she had \\npolished, whose chin hair she had plucked with tweezers. Giti, who was going to marry \\nSabir the goalkeeper. Giti was dead.  Dead.  Blown to piece s. At last, Laila began to weep \\nfor her friend.

Almost everyone she knew had packed \\ntheir things and left. The neighborhood had been all but drained of familiar faces, and now, \\nonly four months after fighting had broken out between the Mujahideen factions, Laila \\nhardly recognized anybody on the streets anymore. Hasina\\'s family had fled in May, off to \\nTehran. Wajma and her clan had gone to Islamabad that same month. Giti\\'s parents and her \\nsiblings left in June, shortly after Giti was killed.

The mountains trapped the bone scorching heat, \\nstifled the city like smoke. Power had been out for days. All over Kabul, electri c fans sat \\nidle, almost mockingly so.  \\n  Laila was lying still on the living room couch, sweating through her blouse. Every exhaled \\nbreath burned the tip of her nose. She was aware of her parents talking in Mammy's room. \\nTwo nights ago, and again last night , she had awakened and thought she heard their voices \\ndownstairs. They were talking every day now, ever since the bullet, ever since the new hole \\nin the gate.  \\n  Outside, the far off  boom  of artillery, then, more closely, the stammering of a long string \\nof gunfire, followed by another.  \\n  Inside Laila too a battle was being waged: guilt on one side, partnered with shame, and, on \\nthe other, the conviction that what she and Tariq had done was not sinful; that it had been \\nnatural, good, beautiful, even inevitabl e, spurred by the knowledge that they might never \\nsee each other again.  \\n  Laila rolled to her side on the couch now and tried to remember something: At one point, \\nwhen they were on the floor, Tariq had lowered his forehead on hers. Then he had panted \\nsomet hing, either  Am I hurting you?  Or Is this hurting you?  \\n  Laila couldn't decide which he had said.  \\n \\n  Am I  hurting you?  \\n  Is this hurting you?  \\n  Only two weeks since he had left, and it was already happening  Time, blunting the \\nedges of those sharp memories . Laila bore down mentally. What had he said? It seemed \\nvital, suddenly, that she know.  \\n  Laila closed her  eyes.  Concentrated.  \\n  With the passing of time, she would slowly tire of this exercise. She would find it \\nincreasingly exhausting to conjure up, to d ust off, to resuscitate once again what was long \\ndead. There would come a day, in fact, years later, when Laila would no longer bewail his \\nloss. Or not as relentlessly; not nearly. There would come a day when the details of his face \\nwould begin to slip fro m memory's grip, when overhearing a mother on the street call after \\nher child by Tariq's name would no longer cut her adrift. She would not miss him as she did \\nnow, when the ache of his absence was her unremitting companion like the phantom pain \\nof an ampu tee. \\n  Except every once in a long while, when Laila was a grown woman, ironing a shirt or \\npushing her children on a swing set, something trivial, maybe the warmth of a carpet \\nbeneath her feet on a hot day or the curve of a stranger's forehead, would set o ff a memory \\nof that afternoon together. And it would all come rushing back. The spontaneity of it. Their \\nastonishing imprudence. Their clumsiness. The pain of the act, the pleasure of it, the \\nsadness of it. The heat of their entangled bodies.  \\n  It would fl ood her, steal her breath.  \\n \\n  But then it would pass. The moment would pass.

All three of us. We\\'re leaving Kabul.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  In Mammy\\'s room, t he three of them sat on the bed.  Outside, rockets  were zipping across  \\nthe sky as Hekmatyar\\'s and Massoud\\'s  forces  fought and fought. Laila knew that \\nsomewhere in the city someone had just  died,  and that a pall of black smoke was hovering \\nover some building  that had collapsed in a puffing mass of dust. There would be bodies to \\nstep around in the morning. Some would be collected. Others not. Then Kabul\\'s dogs, who \\nhad developed a taste for human meat, would feast.  \\n  All the same, Laila had an urge to run thro ugh those streets.  She could barely contain her \\nown happiness. It took effort  to sit, to  not shriek with  joy. Babi  said they would go to \\nPakistan first, to apply for  visas. Pakistan,  where Tariq was! Tariq was only gone seventeen \\ndays, Laila calculated exc itedly. If only Mammy had made up her mind  seventeen  days \\nearlier, they could have left together. She would have been with Tariq right now! But that \\ndidn\\'t  matter now.  They were going  to Peshawar she, Mammy, and Babi and they would \\nfind Tariq and his paren ts there. Surely they would. They would process their paperwork \\ntogether. Then, who knew? Who knew? Europe?  \\n \\n  America? Maybe, as Babi was always saying, somewhere near the sea…  \\n  Mammy was half lying, half sitting against the headboard. Her eyes were puff y. She was \\npicking at her hair.  \\n  Three days before, Laila had gone outside for a breath of air. She\\'d stood by the front \\ngates, leaning against them, when she\\'d heard a loud crack and something had zipped by \\nher right ear, sending tiny splinters of wood f lying before her eyes. After Giti\\'s death, and \\nthe thousands of rounds fired and myriad rockets that had fallen on Kabul, it was the sight \\nof that single round hole in the gate, less than three fingers away from where Laila\\'s head \\nhad been, that shook Mamm y awake. Made her see that one war had cost her two children \\nalready; this latest could cost her her remaining one.  \\n  From the walls of the room, Ahmad and Noor smiled down. Laila watched Mammy\\'s eyes \\nbouncing now, guiltily, from one photo to the other. As  if looking for their consent. Their \\nblessing. As if asking for forgiveness.  \\n  \"There\\'s nothing left for us here,\" Babi said. \"Our sons are gone, but we still have Laila. \\nWe still have each other, Fariba. We can make a new life.\"  \\n  Babi reached across the bed. When he leaned to take her hands, Mammy let him. On her \\nface, a look of concession. Of resignation. They held each other\\'s hands, lightly, and then \\nthey were swaying quietly in an embrace. Mammy buried her face in his neck. She grabbed \\na handful of hi s shirt.  \\n  For hours that night, the excitement robbed Laila of sleep. She lay in bed and watched the \\nhorizon light up in garish shades of orange and yellow. At some point, though, despite the \\nexhilaration inside and the crack of  \\n  artillery fire outside, she fell asleep.  '),\n",

It\\'s a  chilly, overcast day, but it\\'s warm \\nnext to Tariq under the blanket draped over their shoulders. She can see cars parked behind \\na low fence of chipped white paint be neath a row of windswept palm trees. The wind \\nmakes her eyes water and buries their shoes in sand, hurls knots of dead grass from the \\ncurved ridges  of one dune to another. They\\'re watching sailboats bob in the distance. \\nAround them, seagulls squawk and shi ver in the wind. The wind whips up another spray of \\nsand off the shallow, windward  slopes . There is a noise  then like  a chant, and she tells  him \\nsomething Babi had taught her years before about singing sand.  \\n  He rubs at her eyebrow, wipes  grains  of sand f rom it. She  catches a flicker of the band on \\nhis finger. It\\'s identical  to hers  gold with a sort of maze pattern  etched  all the way around.  \\n  It\\'s true, she tells him. It\\'s the friction, of grain against grain. Listen.  He does.  He frowns. \\nThey wait. They hear it again. A groaning sound, when the wind is soft, when it blows hard, \\na mewling, high pitched chorus.  \\n  * * * Babi said they  should  take only what was absolutely necessary. They would sell the \\nrest. \\n  \"That should hold us in Peshawar until I find wor k.\" \\n \\n  For the next two days, they gathered items to be sold. They put them in big piles.  \\n  In her room, Laila set aside old blouses, old shoes, books, toys. Looking under her bed, \\nshe found a tiny yellow glass cow Hasina had passed to her during recess in  fifth grade. A \\nminiature soccer ball key chain, a gift from Giti. A little wooden zebra on wheels. A \\nceramic astronaut she and Tariq had found one day in a gutter. She\\'d been six and he eight. \\nThey\\'d had a minor row, Laila remembered, over which one of th em had found it.  \\n  Mammy too gathered her things. There was a reluctance in her movements, and her eyes \\nhad a lethargic, faraway look in them. She did away with her good plates, her napkins, all \\nher jewelry save for her wedding band and most of her old clo thes. \\n  \"You\\'re not selling this, are you?\" Laila said, lifting Mammy\\'s wedding dress. It cascaded \\nopen onto her lap. She touched the lace and ribbon along the neckline, the hand sewn seed \\npearls on the sleeves.  \\n  Mammy shrugged and took it from her. She t ossed it brusquely on a pile of clothes. Like \\nripping off a Band Aid in one stroke, Laila thought.  \\n  It was Babi who had the most painful task.  \\n  Laila found him standing in his study, a rueful expression on his face as he surveyed his \\nshelves. He was wear ing a secondhand T shirt with a picture of San Francisco\\'s red bridge \\non it. Thick fog rose from the white capped  waters and engulfed the bridge\\'s towers.  \\n \\n  \"You know the old bit,\" he said. \"You\\'re on a deserted island. You can have five books. \\nWhich do y ou choose? I never thought I\\'d actually have to.\"  \\n  \"We\\'ll have to start you a new collection, Babi.\"  \\n  \"Mm.\" He smiled sadly. \"I can\\'t believe I\\'m leaving Kabul. I went to school here, got my \\nfirst job here, became a father in this town. It\\'s strange to t hink that I\\'ll be sleeping beneath \\nanother city\\'s skies soon.\"  \\n  \"It\\'s strange for me too.\"  \\n  \"All day, this poem about Kabul has been bouncing around in my head.

She put an arm around his waist. \"Oh, Babi. We\\'ll \\ncome back. When this war is over. We\\'ll come back to Kabul,  inshallah.  You\\'ll see.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  On the third morning, Laila began moving the piles of things to the yard and depositing \\nthem by the front door. They would fetch a taxi then and take it all to a pa wnshop.  \\n \\n  Laila kept shuffling between the house and the yard, back and forth, carrying stacks of \\nclothes and dishes and box after box of Babi\\'s books. She should have been exhausted by \\nnoon, when the mound of belongings by the front door had grown waist high. But, with \\neach trip, she knew that she was that much closer to seeing Tariq again, and, with each trip, \\nher legs became more sprightly, her arms more tireless.  \\n  \"We\\'re going to need a big taxi.\"  \\n  Laila looked up. It was Mammy calling down from her bedroom upstairs. She was leaning \\nout the window, resting her elbows on the sill. The sun, bright and warm, caught in her \\ngraying hair, shone on her drawn, thin face. Mammy was wearing the same cobalt blue \\ndress she had worn the day of the lunch party four  months earlier, a youthful dress meant \\nfor a young woman, but, for a moment, Mammy looked to Laila like an old woman. An old \\nwoman with stringy arms and sunken temples and slow eyes rimmed by darkened circles of \\nweariness, an altogether different creature  from the plump, round faced woman beaming \\nradiantly from those grainy wedding photos.  \\n  \"Two big taxis,\" Laila said.  \\n  She could see Babi too, in the living room stacking boxes of books atop each other.  \\n  \"Come up when you\\'re done with those,\" Mammy said.  \"We\\'ll sit down for lunch. Boiled \\neggs and leftover beans.\"  \\n  \"My favorite,\" Laila said.  \\n \\n  She thought suddenly of her dream. She and Tariq on a quilt. The ocean. The wind. The \\ndunes.  \\n  What had it sounded like, she wondered now, the singing sands?  \\n  Laila stopped. She saw a gray lizard crawl out of a crack in the ground. Its head shot side \\nto side. It blinked. Darted under a rock.  \\n  Laila pictured the beach again. Except now the singing was all around. And growing. \\nLouder and louder by the moment, higher  and higher. It flooded her ears. Drowned \\neverything else out. The gulls were feathered mimes now, opening and closing their beaks \\nnoiselessly, and the waves were crashing with foam and spray but no roar. The sands sang \\non. Screaming now. A sound like…a ti nkling?  \\n  Not a tinkling. No. A whistling.  \\n  Laila dropped the books at her feet. She looked up to the sky. Shielded her eyes with one \\nhand.  \\n  Then a giant roar.  \\n  Behind her, a flash of white.  '),\n",

It knocked her out of her \\nsandals. Lifted her up. And now she was flying, twisting and rotating in the air, seeing sky, \\nthen earth, then sky, then earth. A big burning chunk of wood whipped by. So did a \\nthousand shards o f glass, and it seemed to Laila that she could see each individual one \\nflying all around her, flipping slowly end over end, the sunlight catching in each. Tiny, \\nbeautiful rainbows.  \\n  Then Laila struck the wall. Crashed to the ground. On her face and arms, a shower of dirt \\nand pebbles and glass. The last thing she was aware of was seeing something thud to the \\nground nearby. A bloody chunk of something. On it, the tip of a red bridge poking through \\nthick fog.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Shapes moving about. A fluorescent light  shines from the ceiling above. A woman's face \\nappears, hovers over hers.  \\n  Laila fades back to the dark.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Another face. This time a man's. His features seem broad and droopy. His lips move but \\nmake no sound. All Laila hears is ringing.  \\n  The man waves his hand at her. Frowns. His lips move again.  \\n \\n  It hurts. It hurts to breathe. It hurts everywhere.  \\n  A glass of water. A pink pill.  \\n  Back to the darkness.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The woman again. Long face, narrow set eyes. She says something. Laila can't hear \\nanything but the ringing. But she can see the words, like thick black syrup, spilling out of \\nthe woman's mouth.  \\n  Her chest hurts. Her arms and legs hurt.  \\n  All around, shapes moving.  \\n  Where is Tariq?  \\n  Why isn't he here?  \\n  Darkness. A flock of stars.  \\n \\n  Babi and she, perched somewhere high up. He is pointing to a field of barley. A generator \\ncomes to life.  \\n  The long faced woman is standing over her looking down.  \\n  It hurts to breathe.  \\n  Somewhere, an accordion playing.  \\n  Mercifully, the pink pill again.

She mouthed something.  \\n  Mariam leaned in closer.  \\n  \"This ear,\" the girl breathed. \"I can\\'t hear.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  For the first \"week, the girl did little but sleep, with help from the pink pills Rasheed paid \\nfor at the hospital. She murmured in her sleep. S ometimes she spoke gibberish, cried out, \\ncalled out names Mariam did not recognize. She wept in her sleep, grew agitated, kicked \\nthe blankets off, and then Mariam had to hold her down. Sometimes she retched and \\nretched, threw up everything Mariam fed her.  \\n  When she wasn\\'t agitated, the girl was a sullen pair of eyes staring from under the blanket, \\nbreathing out short little answers to Mariam and Rasheed\\'s questions. Some days she was \\nchildlike, whipped her head side to side, when Mariam, then Rasheed, trie d to feed her. She \\nwent rigid when Mariam came at her with a spoon. But she tired easily and submitted \\neventually to their persistent badgering. Long bouts of weeping followed surrender.  \\n  Rasheed had Mariam rub antibiotic ointment on the cuts on the girl\\' s face and neck, and \\non the sutured gashes on her shoulder, across her forearms and lower legs. Mariam dressed \\nthem with bandages, which she washed and recycled. She held the girl\\'s hair back, out of \\nher face, when she had to retch.  \\n  \"How long is she stay ing?\" she asked Rasheed.  \\n  \"Until she\\'s better. Look at her. She\\'s in no shape to go. Poor thing.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  It was Rasheed who found the girl, who dug her out from beneath the rubble.  \\n  \"Lucky I was home,\" he said to the girl. He was sitting on a folding chair beside Mariam\\'s \\nbed, where the girl lay. \"Lucky for you, I mean. I dug you out with my own hands. There \\nwas a scrap of metal this big \" Here, he spread his thumb and index finger apart to show her, \\nat least doubling, in Mariam\\'s estimation, the actua l size of it. \"This big.

The rest were looted, I\\'m afraid.\"  \\n  He helped Mariam watch over the girl that first week. One day, he came home from work \\nwith a new blanket and pillow. Another day, a bottle of pills.  \\n  \"Vitamins,\" he said.  \\n  It was Rasheed who gave Laila the news that her friend Tariq\\'s house was occupied now.  \\n  \"A gift,\" he said. \"From one of Sayyaf s commanders to three of his men. A gift. Ha!\"  \\n  The three  men were actually boys with suntanned, youthful faces. Mariam would see them  \\nwhen she passed by, always dressed in their fatigues, squatting by the front door of Tariq\\'s \\nhouse, playing cards and smoking, their Kalashnikovs leaning against the wall. The brawny \\none, the one with the self satisfied, scornful demeanor, was the leader.  The youngest was \\nalso the quietest, the one who seemed reluctant to wholeheartedly embrace his friends\\' air \\nof impunity. He had taken to smiling and tipping his head  salaam  when Mariam passed by. \\nWhen he did, some of his surface smugness dropped away, and  Mariam caught a glint of \\nhumility as yet uncorrupted.  \\n  Then one morning rockets slammed into the house. They were rumored later to have been \\nfired by the Hazaras of Wahdat. For some time, neighbors kept finding bits and pieces of \\nthe boys.  \\n  \"They had it  coming,\" said Rasheed.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The girl was extraordinarily lucky, Mariam thought, to escape with relatively minor \\ninjuries, considering the rocket had turned her house into smoking rubble. And so, slowly , \\nthe girl got better. She began to eat more, beg an to brush her own hair. She took baths on \\nher own. She began taking her meals downstairs, with Mariam and Rasheed.  \\n  But then some memory would rise, unbidden, and there would be stony silences or spells \\nof churlishness. Withdrawals and collapses. Wan lo oks. Nightmares and sudden attacks of \\ngrief. Retching.  \\n  And sometimes regrets.  \\n  \"I shouldn\\'t even be here,\"  she said one day.  \\n  Mariam was changing the sheets. The girl watched  from  the floor , her bruised  knees  \\ndrawn up against her chest.  \\n  \"My father wa nted to take out the boxes. The books. He said they were too heavy  for me. \\nBut I wouldn\\'t let him. I was so eager. I sh ould have been the one inside the house when it \\nhappened.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam snapped the clean sheet and let it settle on the bed She looked at t he girl, at her \\nblond curls, her slender neck and green eyes, her high cheekbones and plump lips. Mariam \\nremembered seeing her on the streets when she was little, tottering after her mother on the \\nway to the tandoor, riding on the shoulders of her brother,  the younger one, with the patch \\nof hair on his ear. Shooting marbles with the carpenter\\'s boy.  \\n  The girl was looking back as if waiting for Mariam to pass on some morsel of wisdom, to \\nsay something encouraging  But what wisdom did Mariam have to offer? W hat \\nencouragement? Mariam remembered the day they\\'d buried Nana and how little comfort \\nshe had found when Mullah Faizullah had quoted the Koran for her.

Or when he\\'d said of her own guilt,  These thoughts are no good, \\nMariam jo. They will destroy you.

But he would go on in a second, and she  \\nresisted an urge to get up and leave, leave before he told her things she didn\\'t want to hear.  \\n  Abdul Sharif set his glass on the table.  \\n  \"That\\'s where I met your friend, Mohammad Tariq Walizai.\"  \\n  Laila\\'s heart sped up. Tariq in a hospital? A special u nit? For really sick people?  \\n  She swallowed dry spit. Shifted on her chair. She had to steel herself. If she didn\\'t, she \\nfeared she would come unhinged. She diverted her thoughts from hospitals and special \\nunits and thought instead about the fact that she  hadn\\'t heard Tariq called by his full name \\nsince the two of them had enrolled in a Farsi winter course years back. The teacher would \\ncall roll after the bell and say his name like that Mohammad Tariq Walizai. It had struck \\nher as comically officious then,  hearing his full name uttered.  \\n  \"What happened to him I heard from one of the nurses,\" Abdul Sharif resumed, tapping \\nhis chest with a fist as if to ease the passage of the pill. \"With all the time I\\'ve spent in \\nPeshawar, I\\'ve become pretty proficient in Urdu. Anyway, what I gathered was that your \\nfriend was in a lorry full of refugees, twenty three of them, all headed for Peshawar. Near \\nthe border, they were caught in cross fire. A rocket hit the lorry. Probably a stray, but you \\nnever know with these peop le, you never know. There were only six survivors, all of them \\nadmitted to the same unit. Three died within twenty four hours. Two of them lived sisters, \\nas I understood it and had been discharged.  \\n  Your friend Mr. Walizai was the last. He\\'d been there fo r almost three weeks by the time I \\narrived.\"  \\n  So he was alive. But how badly had they hurt him? Laila wondered frantically. How badly? \\nBadly enough to be put in a special unit, evidently. Laila was aware that she had started \\nsweating, that her face felt h ot. She tried to think of something else, something pleasant, \\nlike the trip to Bamiyan to see the Buddhas with Tariq and Babi. But instead an image of \\nTariq\\'s parents presented itself: Tariq\\'s mother trapped in the lorry, upside down, screaming \\nfor Tariq t hrough the smoke, her arms and chest on fire, the wig melting into her scalp…  \\n  Laila had to take a series of rapid breaths.  \\n  \"He was in the bed next to mine. There were no walls, only a curtain between us. So I \\ncould see him pretty well.\"  \\n  Abdul Sharif found a sudden need to toy with his wedding band. He spoke more slowly \\nnow.  \\n  \"Your friend, he was badly very badly injured, you understand. He had rubber tubes \\ncoming out of him everywhere. At first \" He cleared his throat. \"At first, I thought he\\'d lost \\nboth legs in the attack, but a nurse said no, only the right, the left one was on account of an \\nold injury. There were internal injuries too. They\\'d operated three times already. Took out \\nsections of intestines, I don\\'t remember what else. And he was burne d. Quite badly. That\\'s \\nall I\\'ll say about that. I\\'m sure you have your fair share of nightmares,  hamshira.  No sense \\nin me adding to them.\"  \\n  Tariq was legless now. He was a torso with two stumps.  Legless.  Laila thought she might \\ncollapse. With deliberate, desperate effort, she sent the tendrils of her mind out of this room, \\nout the window, away from this man, over the street outside, over the city now, and its flat \\ntopped houses and bazaars, its maze of narrow streets turned to sand castles.  \\n  \"He was drugg ed up most of the time. For the pain, you understand. But he had moments \\nwhen the drugs were wearing off when he was clear. In pain but clear of mind I would talk '),\n",

I told him who I was, where I was from. He was glad, I think, that \\nthere was a hamwaian  next to him.  \\n  \"I did most of the talking. It was hard for him to. His voice was hoarse, and I think it hurt \\nhim to move his lips. So I told him about my daughters, and about our house in Peshawar \\nand the veranda my brother in law and I are b uilding out in the back. I told him I had sold \\nthe stores in Kabul and that I was going back to finish up the paperwork. It wasn\\'t much. \\nBut it occupied him. At least, I like to think it did.  \\n  \"Sometimes he talked too. Half the time, I couldn\\'t make out w hat he was saying, but I \\ncaught enough. He described where he\\'d lived.  \\n  He talked about his uncle in Ghazni. And his mother\\'s cooking and his father\\'s carpentry, \\nhim playing the accordion.  \\n  \"But, mostly, he talked about you,  hamshira.  He said you were ho w did he put it his \\nearliest memory. I think that\\'s right, yes. I could tell he cared a great deal about you.  Balay,  \\nthat much was plain to see. But he said he was glad you weren\\'t there. He said he didn\\'t \\nwant you seeing him like that.\"  \\n  Laila\\'s feet fel t heavy again, anchored to the floor, as if all her blood had suddenly pooled \\ndown there. But her mind was far away, free and fleet, hurtling like a speeding missile \\nbeyond Kabul, over craggy brown hills and over deserts ragged with clumps of sage, past \\ncanyons of jagged red rock and over snowcapped mountains…  \\n  \"When I told him I was going back to Kabul, he asked me to find you. To tell you that he \\nwas thinking of you. That he missed you. I promised him I would I\\'d taken quite a liking to \\nhim, you see. He was a decent sort of boy, I could tell.\"  \\n  Abdul Sharif wiped his brow with the handkerchief.  \\n  \"I woke up one night,\" he went on, his interest in the wedding band renewed, \"I think it \\nwas night anyway, it\\'s hard  \\n  to tell in those places. There aren\\'t any  windows. Sunrise, sundown, you just don\\'t know. \\nBut I woke up, and there was some sort of commotion around the bed next to mine. You \\nhave to understand that I was full of drugs myself, always slipping in and out, to the point \\nwhere it was hard to tell wha t was real and what you\\'d dreamed up. All I remember is, \\ndoctors huddled around the bed, calling for this and that, alarms bleeping, syringes all over \\nthe ground.  \\n  \"In the morning, the bed was empty. I asked a nurse. She said he fought valiantly.\"  \\n  Laila  was dimly aware that she was nodding. She\\'d known. Of course she\\'d known. She\\'d \\nknown the moment she had sat across from this man why he was here, what news he was \\nbringing.  \\n  \"At first, you see, at first I didn\\'t think you even existed,\" he was saying no w. \"I thought it \\nwas the morphine talking. Maybe I even  hoped  you didn\\'t exist; I\\'ve always dreaded bearing \\nbad news. But I promised him. And, like I said, I\\'d become rather fond of him. So I came \\nby here a few days ago. I asked around for you, talked to s ome neighbors. They pointed to \\nthis house. They also told me what had happened to your parents. When I heard about that, \\nwell, I turned around and left. I wasn\\'t going to tell you. I decided it would be too much for \\nyou. For anybody.\"  \\n  Abdul Sharif reache d across the table and put a hand on her kneecap. \"But I came back. \\nBecause, in the end, I think he would have wanted you to know. I believe that. I\\'m so sorry. \\nI wish…\"  \\n  Laila wasn\\'t listening anymore. She was remembering the day the man from Panjshir ha d '),\n",

She remembered Babi, white faced, \\nslumping on the couch, and Mammy, her hand flying to her mouth when she heard. Laila \\nhad watched Mammy come undone that day and it had scared her, but she hadn't fel t any \\ntrue sorrow. She hadn't understood the awfulness of her mother's loss. Now another \\nstranger bringing news of another death. Now  she was the one sitting on the chair. Was this \\nher penalty, then, her punishment for being aloof to her own mother's suffe ring?  \\n  Laila remembered how Mammy had dropped to the ground, how she'd screamed, torn at \\nher hair. But Laila couldn't even manage that. She could hardly move. She could hardly \\nmove a muscle.  \\n  She sat on the chair instead, hands limp in her lap, eyes star ing at nothing, and let her \\nmind fly on. She let it fly on until it found the place, the good and safe place, where the \\nbarley fields were green, where the water ran clear and the cottonwood seeds danced by the \\nthousands in the air; where Babi was reading a book beneath an acacia and Tariq was \\nnapping with his hands laced across his chest, and where she could dip her feet in the \\nstream and dream good dreams beneath the watchful gaze of gods of ancient, sun bleached \\nrock.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \"),\n",

It\\'s a terrible thing, what\\'s happened. Too many \\nyoung Afghan men  are dying this way.\"  \\n  He motioned impatiently with his hand, still looking at the girl, and Mariam passed him a \\nnapkin.  \\n  For years, Mariam had looked on as he ate, the muscles of his temples churning, one hand \\nmaking compact little rice balls, the back of the other wiping grease, swiping stray grains, \\nfrom the corners of his mouth. For years, he had eaten without looking up, without \\nspeaking, his silence condemning, as though some judgment were being passed, then \\nbroken only by an accusatory grunt, a dis approving cluck of his tongue, a one word \\ncommand for more bread, more water.  \\n  Now he ate with a spoon. Used a napkin. Said  lotfan when asking for water. And talked. \\nSpiritedly and incessantly.  \\n  \"If you ask me, the Americans armed the wrong man in Hekmat yar. All the guns the CIA \\nhanded him in the eighties to fight the Soviets. The Soviets are gone, but he still has the \\nguns, and now he\\'s turning them on innocent people like your parents. And he calls this \\njihad. What a farce! What does jihad have to do wi th killing women and children? Better \\nthe CIA had armed Commander Massoud.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam\\'s eyebrows shot up of their own will.  Commander  Massoud? In her head, she \\ncould hear Rasheed\\'s rants against Massoud, how he was a traitor and a communist  But, \\nthen, Mas soud was a Tajik, of course. Like Laila.  \\n  \"Now,  there  is a reasonable fellow. An honorable Afghan. A man genuinely interested in a \\npeaceful resolution.\"  \\n  Rasheed shrugged and sighed.  \\n  \"Not that they give a damn in America, mind you. What do they care th at Pashtuns and \\nHazaras and Tajiks and Uzbeks are killing each other? How many Americans can even tell \\none from the other? Don\\'t expect help from them, I say. Now that the Soviets have \\ncollapsed, we\\'re no use to them. We served our purpose. To them, Afghan istan is a kenarab,  \\na shit hole. Excuse my language, but it\\'s true. What do you think, Laila jan?\"  \\n  The girl mumbled something unintelligible and pushed a meatball around in her bowl.  \\n  Rasheed nodded thoughtfully, as though she\\'d said the most clever thin g he\\'d ever heard. \\nMariam had to look away.  \\n  \"You know, your father, God give him peace, your father and I used to have discussions \\nlike this. This was before you were born, of course. On and on we\\'d go about politics. \\nAbout books too. Didn\\'t we, Mariam?

Like a performance. An attempt on his part, both sly and  \\npathetic, to impress. To charm.  \\n  And suddenly Mariam knew that her suspicions were right. She understood with a dread \\nthat was like a blinding whack to the side of her head that what she was witnessing was \\nnothing less than a courtship.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  When sh ed at last worked up the nerve, Mariam went to his room.  \\n  Rasheed lit a cigarette, and said, \"Why not?\"  \\n  Mariam knew right then that she was defeated. She\\'d half expected, half hoped, that he \\nwould deny everything, feign surprise, maybe even outrage, at what she was implying. She \\nmight have had the upper hand then. She might have succeeded in shaming him. But it stole \\nher grit, his calm acknowledgment, his matter of fact tone.  \\n  \"Sit down,\" he said. He was lying on his bed, back to the wall, his thick, lo ng legs splayed \\non the mattress. \"Sit down before you faint and cut your head open.\"  \\n  Mariam felt herself drop onto the folding chair beside his bed.  \\n  \"Hand me that ashtray, would you?\" he said.  \\n  Obediently, she did.  \\n  Rasheed had to be sixty or more no w though Mariam, and in fact Rasheed himself did not \\nknow his exact age. His hair had gone white, but it was as thick and coarse as ever. There \\nwas a sag now to his eyelids and the skin of his neck, which was wrinkled and leathery. His \\ncheeks hung a bit mo re than they used to. In the mornings, he stooped just a tad. But he still \\nhad the stout shoulders, the thick torso, the strong hands, the swollen belly that entered the \\nroom before any other part of him did.  \\n  On the whole, Mariam thought that he had weat hered the years considerably better than \\nshe. \\n  \"We need to legitimize this situation,\" he said now, balancing the ashtray on his belly. His \\nlips scrunched up in a playful pucker. \"People will talk. It looks dishonorable, an unmarried \\nyoung woman living he re. It\\'s bad for my reputation. And hers. And yours, I might add.\"  \\n  \"Eighteen years,\" Mariam said. \"And I never asked you for a thing. Not one thing. I\\'m \\nasking now.\"  \\n  He inhaled smoke and let it out slowly. \"She can\\'t just  stay here, if that\\'s what you\\' re \\nsuggesting. I can\\'t go on feeding her and clothing her and giving her a place to sleep. I\\'m \\nnot the Red Cross, Mariam.\"  \\n  \"But this?\"  \\n  \"What of it? What? She\\'s too young, you think? She\\'s fourteen.  Hardly a child. You were  \\nfifteen, remember? My mother was fourteen when she had me. Thirteen when she married.\"  \\n  \"I...I don\\'t  want  this,\"  Mariam said, numb with contempt and helplessness.  \\n  \"It\\'s not your decision. It\\'s hers and  mine.\"  \\n  \"I\\'m too old.\"  \\n  \"She\\'s too  young, you\\'re  too old. This is nonsense.\"  \\n  \"I am too old.

You know it\\'s true.\"  \\n  \"I won\\'t allow it.\"  \\n \\n  At this, Rasheed smiled sadly.  \\n  \"There  is another option,\" he said, scratching the sole of one foot with the calloused heel \\nof the other. \"She can leave. I won\\'t stand in her way. But I suspect she won\\'t get far. No \\nfood, no water, not a rupiah in her pockets, bullets and rockets flying everywhere.

And that\\'s before \\nwinter. Then it\\'s frostbite season. Pneumonia. People turning to icicles. Those camps \\nbecome frozen graveyards.  \\n  \"Of course,\" he made a playful, twirling motion with his hand, \"she could keep warm in \\none of those Peshawar brothels. Business is booming there, I hear.

I don\\'t really blame you. But  this is  for the  best. You\\'ll  see. Think of \\nit this way, Mariam. I\\'m giving  you help around the house and  her a sanctuary. A home and \\na husband.

She was under the blanket in the morning when \\nRasheed poked his head in and said he was going to the barber. She was still in bed \\nwhen he came home late in the afternoon, when he showed her his new haircut, his new \\nused suit, blue with cream pinstripes, and the wedding band he\\'d bought her.  \\n  Rasheed sat on the bed beside her, made a great show of slowly undoing the ribbon, of \\nopening the box and plucking out the ring delicately. He let on that he\\'d traded in Mariam\\'s \\nold wedding ring fo r it. \\n  \"She doesn\\'t care. Believe me. She won\\'t even notice.\"  \\n  Laila pulled away to the far end of the bed. She could hear Mariam downstairs, the hissing \\nof her iron.  \\n  \"She never wore it anyway,\" Rasheed said.  \\n  \"I don\\'t want it,\" Laila said, weakly. \"N ot like this. You have to take it back.\"  \\n  \"Take it back?\" An impatient look flashed across his face and was gone. He smiled. \"I had \\nto add some cash too quite a lot, in fact. This is a better ring, twenty two karat gold. Feel \\nhow heavy? Go on, feel it. No ?\" He closed the box. \"How about flowers? That would be \\nnice. You like flowers? Do you have a favorite? Daisies?  \\n \\n  Tulips? Lilacs? No flowers? Good! I don\\'t see the point myself. I just thought…Now, I \\nknow a tailor here in Deh Mazang. I was thinking we co uld take you there tomorrow, get \\nyou fitted for a proper dress.\"  \\n  Laila shook her head.  \\n  Rasheed raised his eyebrows.  \\n  \"I\\'d just as soon \" Laila began.  \\n  He put a hand on her neck. Laila couldn\\'t help wincing and recoiling. His touch felt like \\nwearing a  prickly old wet wool sweater with no undershirt.  \\n  \"Yes?\"  \\n  \"I\\'d just as soon we get it done.\"  \\n  Rasheed\\'s mouth opened, then spread in a yellow, toothy grin. \"Eager,\" he said.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Before Abdul Sharif\\'s visit, Laila had decided to leave for Pakistan .

She might have taken the \\nrisk. \\n  But, suddenly, leaving was no longer an option.  \\n  Not with this daily retching.  \\n  This new fullness in her breasts.  \\n  And the awareness, somehow, amid all of this turmoil, that she had missed a cycle.  \\n  Laila pictured  herself in a refugee camp, a stark field with thousands of sheets of plastic \\nstrung to makeshift poles flapping in the cold, stinging wind.

She pictured its tiny body washed by strangers, wrapped in a tawny \\nshroud, lowered into a hole dug in a patch of windswept land under the disappointed gaze \\nof vultures.  \\n  How could she run now?  \\n  Laila took grim inventory of the peopl e in her life. Ahmad and Noor, dead. Hasina, gone. \\nGiti, dead. Mammy, dead. Babi, dead. Now Tariq…  \\n  But, miraculously, something of her former life remained, her last link to the person that \\nshe had been before she had become so utterly alone. A part of T ariq still alive inside her, \\nsprouting tiny arms, growing translucent hands.  \\n \\n  How could she jeopardize the only thing she had left of him, of her old life?  \\n  She made her decision quickly. Six weeks had passed since her time with Tariq. Any \\nlonger and Ra sheed would grow suspicious.  \\n  She knew that what she was doing was dishonorable. Dishonorable, disingenuous, and \\nshameful. And spectacularly unfair to Mariam. But even though the baby inside her was no \\nbigger than a mulberry, Laila already saw the sacrifi ces a mother had to make. Virtue was \\nonly the first.  \\n  She put a hand on her belly. Closed her eyes.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Laila would remember the muted ceremony in bits and fragments. The cream colored \\nstripes of Rasheed\\'s suit. The sharp smell of his hair spray. Th e small shaving nick just \\nabove his Adam\\'s apple. The rough pads of his tobacco stained fingers when he slid the ring \\non her. The pen. It’s not working. The search for a new pen. The contract. The signing, his \\nsure handed, hers quavering. The prayers. Noti cing, in the mirror, that Rasheed had \\ntrimmed his eyebrows.  \\n  And, somewhere in the room, Mariam watching. The air choking with her disapproval.  \\n  Laila could not bring herself to meet the older woman\\'s gaze.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Lying beneath his cold sheets that ni ght, she watched him pull the curtains shut. She was \\nshaking even before his fingers worked her shirt buttons, tugged at the drawstring of her \\ntrousers. He was agitated. His fingers fumbled endlessly with his own shirt, with undoing \\nhis belt. Laila had a f ull view of his sagging breasts, his protruding belly button, the small \\nblue vein in the center of it, the tufts of thick white hair on his chest, his shoulders, and \\nupper arms. She felt his eyes crawling all over her.  \\n  \"God help me, I think I love you,\" he said Through chattering teeth, she asked him to turn \\nout the lights.  \\n  Later, when she was sure that he was asleep, Laila quietly reached beneath the mattress \\nfor the knife she had hidden there earlier. With it, she punctured the pad of her index finger . \\nThen she lifted the blanket and let her finger bleed on the sheets where they had lain \\ntogether.  \\n '),\n",

She was water splashing in the bathroom, or a teaspoon clinking against glass \\nin the bedroom upstairs. Occasionally, there were sightings: a blur of billowing dress in the \\nperiphery of Madam\\'s vision, scurrying up the steps, arms folded across the chest, sandals \\nslapping the heels.  \\n  But it was inevit able that they would run into each other. Madam passed the girl on the \\nstairs, in the narrow hallway, in the kitchen, or by the door as she was coming in from the \\nyard. When they met like this, an awkward tension rushed into the space between them. \\nThe gir l gathered her skirt and breathed out a word or two of apology, and, as she hurried \\npast, Madam would chance a sidelong glance and catch a blush. Sometimes she could smell \\nRasheed on her. She could smell his sweat on the girl\\'s skin, his tobacco, his appet ite. Sex, \\nmercifully, was a closed chapter in her own life. It had been for some time, and now even \\nthe thought of those laborious sessions of lying beneath Rasheed made Madam queasy in \\nthe gut.  \\n  At night, however, this mutually orchestrated dance of avoi dance between her and the girl \\nwas not possible. Rasheed said they were a family. He insisted they were, and families had \\nto eat together, he said.  \\n  \"What is this?\" he said, his fingers working the meat off a bone the spoon and fork \\ncharade was abandoned a week after he married the girl. \"Have I married a pair of statues? \\nGo on, Madam,  gap bezan,  say something to her. Where are your manners?\"  \\n  Sucking marrow from a bone, he said to the girl, \"But you mustn\\'t blame her. She is quiet. \\nA blessing, really, be cause,  wallah,  if a person hasn\\'t got much to say she might as well be \\nstingy with words. We are city people, you and I, but she is  dehati.

Have you told her, Mariam, have you told her that you are a harami1?  Well, she \\nis. But she is not without qualities, all things considered. You will see for yourself, Laila \\njan. She is sturdy, for one thing, a good worker, and without pretensions . I\\'ll say it this way: \\nIf she were a car, she would be a Volga.\"  \\n  Mariam was a thirty three year old woman now, but that word,  harami,  still had sting. \\nHearing it still made her feel like she was a pest, a cockroach. She remembered Nana \\npulling her wrist s. You are a clumsy Utile  harami . This is my reward for everything I\\'ve \\nendured.

She didn\\'t know how long t he girl had been \\nstanding there, but, when she picked up a shirt and turned around, she found her standing \\nby the doorway, hands cupped around a glassful of tea.  \\n  \"I didn\\'t mean to startle you,\" the girl said. \"I\\'m sorry.\"  \\n  Mariam only looked at her.  \\n  The sun fell on the girl\\'s face, on her large green eyes and her smooth brow, on her high \\ncheekbones and the appealing, thick eyebrows, which were nothing like Mariam\\'s own, thin \\nand featureless. Her yellow hair, uncombed this morning, was middle parted.  \\n  Mariam could see in the stiff way the girl clutched the cup, the tightened shoulders, that \\nshe was nervous. She imagined her sitting on the bed working up the nerve.  \\n \\n  \"The leaves are turning,\" the girl said companionably. \"Have you seen? Autumn is my \\nfavorite. I like the smell of it, when people burn leaves in their gardens. My mother, she \\nliked springtime the best.

She to ok a step forward. She looked \\nrelieved.  \\n  Outside, an oriole was warbling. Someone was pulling a cart; Mariam could hear the \\ncreaking of its hinges, the bouncing and rattling of its iron wheels. There was the sound of \\ngunfire not so far away, a single shot  followed by three more, then nothing.  \\n \\n  \"I won\\'t be your servant,\" Mariam said. \"I won\\'t.\"  \\n  The girl flinched \"No. Of course not!\"  \\n  \"You may be the palace malika  and me a dehati,  but I won\\'t take orders from you.

The women had been sitting in the garden, eating from a platter of fresh \\nmulberries that Wajma had picked from the tree in her yard. The plump mulberries had \\nbeen white and pink, and some the same dark purple as the bursts of tiny veins on Wajma\\'s \\nnose.  \\n  \"You heard how his son died?\" Wajma had said, energetically shoveling another handful \\nof mulberries into her sunken mouth.  \\n  \"He drowned, didn\\'t he?\" Nila, Giti\\'s mother, said. \"At Ghargha Lake, wa sn\\'t it?\"  \\n  \"But did you know, did you know that Rasheed…\" Wajma raised a finger, made a show of \\nnodding and chewing and making them wait for her to swallow. \"Did you know that he \\nused to drink  sharab  back then, that he was crying drunk that day? It\\'s true . Crying drunk, \\nis what I heard. And that was midmorning. By noon, he had passed out on a lounge chair. \\nYou could have fired the noon cannon next to his ear and he wouldn\\'t have batted an \\neyelash.\"  \\n  Laila remembered how Wajma had covered her mouth, burped ; how her tongue had gone \\nexploring between her few remaining teeth.  \\n \\n  \"You can imagine the rest. The boy went into the water unnoticed. They spotted him a \\nwhile later, floating face down . People rushed to help, half trying to wake up the boy, the \\nother h alf the father. Someone bent over the boy, did the…the mouth to mouth thing you\\'re \\nsupposed to do. It was pointless. They could all see that. The boy was gone.\"  \\n  Laila remembered Wajma raising a finger and her voice quivering with piety. \"This is why \\nthe Holy Koran forbids  sharab.  Because it always falls on the sober to pay for the sins of \\nthe drunk. So it does.\"  \\n  It was this story that was circling in Laila\\'s head after she gave Rasheed the news about \\nthe baby. He had immediately hopped on his bicycle, r idden to a mosque, and prayed for a \\nboy. \\n  That night, all during the meal, Laila watched Mariam push a cube of meat around her \\nplate. Laila was there when Rasheed sprang the news on Mariam in a high, dramatic voice \\nLaila had never before witnessed such ch eerful cruelty. Mariam\\'s lashes fluttered when she \\nheard. A flush spread across her face. She sat sulking, looking desolate.  \\n  After, Rasheed went upstairs to listen to his radio, and Laila helped Mariam clear the  \\nsojrah.  \\n  \"I can\\'t imagine what you are no w,\" Mariam said, picking grains of rice and bread crumbs, \\n\"if you were a Benz before.\"  \\n  Laila tried a more lightheaded tactic. \"A train? Maybe a big jumbo jet.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam straightened up. \"I hope you don\\'t think this excuses you from chores.\"  \\n  Laila open ed her mouth, thought better of it.

No?  \\n  Was Mariam mistreating her?  \\n  \"That\\'s it, isn\\'t it?\"  \\n  \"No.\"  \\n  \"Wallah o billah,  I\\'ll go down and teach her a lesson.

Then came the winds, cold and  raw, ripping through the city. They tore off \\nthe last of the clinging leaves, and left the trees looking ghostly against the muted brown of \\nthe hills. The season\\'s first snowfall was light, the flakes no sooner fallen than melted. Then \\nthe roads froze, an d snow gathered in heaps on the rooftops, piled halfway up frost caked \\nwindows. With snow came the kites, once the rulers of Kabul\\'s winter skies, now timid \\ntrespassers in territory claimed by streaking rockets and fighter jets.  \\n  Rasheed kept bringing hom e news of the war, and Laila was baffled by the allegiances \\nthat Rasheed tried to explain to her. Sayyaf was fighting the Hazaras, he said. The Hazaras \\nwere fighting Massoud.  \\n  \"And he\\'s fighting Hekmatyar, of course, who has the support of the Pakistanis.  Mortal \\nenemies, those two, Massoud and Hekmatyar. Sayyaf, he\\'s siding with Massoud. And \\nHekmatyar supports the Hazaras for now.\"  \\n  As for the unpredictable Uzbek commander Dostum, Rasheed said no one knew where he \\nwould stand. Dostum had fought the Soviet s in the 1980s alongside the Mujahideen but had \\ndefected and joined Najibullah\\'s communist puppet regime after the Soviets had left. He \\nhad even earned a medal, presented by Najibullah himself, before defecting once again and \\nreturning to the Mujahideen\\'s side. For the time being, Rasheed said, Dostum was \\nsupporting Massoud.  \\n  In Kabul, particularly in western Kabul, fires raged, and black palls of smoke \\nmushroomed over snow clad buildings. Embassies closed down. Schools collapsed In \\nhospital waiting rooms,  Rasheed said, the wounded were bleeding to death. In operating \\nrooms, limbs were being amputated without anesthesia.  \\n  \"But don\\'t worry,\" he said. \"You\\'re safe with me, my flower, my  gul. Anyone tries to harm \\nyou, I\\'ll rip out their liver and make them ea t it.\" \\n  That winter, everywhere Laila turned, walls blocked her way. She thought longingly of \\nthe wide open skies of her childhood, of her days of going to  buzkashi  tournaments with \\nBabi and shopping at Mandaii with Mammy, of her days of running free in t he streets and \\ngossiping about boys with Giti and Hasina. Her days of sitting with Tariq in a bed of clover \\non the banks of a stream somewhere, trading riddles and candy, watching the sun go down.  '),\n",

Like the bile that kept burning her \\nthroat these days, a deep, paralyzing grief would come rising up Laila\\'s chest. Her legs \\nwould turn to water. She would have to hold  on to something.  \\n  Laila passed that winter of 1992 sweeping the house, scrubbing the pumpkin colored walls \\nof the bedroom she shared with Rasheed, washing clothes outside in a big copper  lagoon.  \\nSometimes she saw herself as if hovering above her own body , saw herself squatting over \\nthe rim of the  logoon,  sleeves rolled up to the elbows, pink hands wringing soapy water \\nfrom one of Rasheed\\'s undershirts. She felt lost then, casting about, like a shipwreck \\nsurvivor, no shore in sight, only miles and miles of  water.  \\n  When it was too cold to go outside, Laila ambled around the house. She walked, dragging \\na fingernail along the wall, down the hallway, then back, down the steps, then up, her face \\nunwashed, hair uncombed. She walked until she ran into Mariam, who  shot her a cheerless \\nglance and went back to slicing the stem off a bell pepper and trimming strips of fat from \\nmeat. A hurtful silence would fill the room, and Laila could almost see the wordless \\nhostility radiating from Mariam like waves of heat rising from asphalt. She would retreat \\nback to her room, sit on the bed, and watch the snow falling.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Rasheed took her to his shoe shop one day.  \\n  When they were out together, he walked alongside her, one hand gripping her by the \\nelbow. For Laila, being out in the streets had become an exercise in avoiding injury. Her \\neyes were still adjusting to the limited, grid like  visibility of the burqa, her feet still \\nstumbling over the hem. She walked in perpetual fear of tripping and falling, of breaking an \\nankle  stepping into a pothole. Still, she found some comfort in the anonymity that the burqa \\nprovided. She wouldn\\'t be recognized this way if she ran into an old acquaintance of hers. \\nShe wouldn\\'t have to watch the surprise in their eyes, or the pity or the gle e, at how far she \\nhad fallen, at how her lofty aspirations had been dashed.  \\n  Rasheed\\'s shop was bigger and more brightly lit than Laila had imagined. He had her sit \\nbehind his crowded workbench, the top of which was littered with old soles and scraps of \\nleftover leather. He showed her his hammers, demonstrated how the sandpaper wheel \\nworked, his voice  ringing high and proud He felt her belly, not through the shirt but under it, \\nhis fingertips cold and rough like bark on her distended skin. Laila remembered  Tariq\\'s \\nhands, soft  but strong, the tortuous, full veins on the backs of them, which she had always \\nfound so appealingly  masculine.  \\n  \"Swelling so quickly,\" Rasheed said. \"It\\'s going to be a big boy. My son  will be \\napahlawanl  Like his father.\"  \\n  Laila pull ed down her shirt. It filled her with fear when he spoke like this. \\n  \"How  are things with Mariam?\"  \\n  She said they were fine.  \\n  \"Good. Good.\"  \\n  She didn\\'t tell him that they\\'d had their first true fight.  \\n  It had happened a few days earlier. Laila had gone  to the kitchen and found Mariam \\nyanking drawers and slamming them  shut. She  was looking, Mariam said, for the long \\nwooden spoon she used to stir rice.  '),\n",

I hardly come in here.\"  \\n  \"I\\'ve noticed.\"  \\n  \"Is that an accusation? It\\'s how you wanted it, remember. You said you would make the \\nmeals.

Is that wh at \\nhappened,  degeh?\\'  \\n  \"I\\'m saying…\" Laila said, trying to maintain control. Usually, she could will herself to \\nabsorb Mariam\\'s derision and finger pointing. But her ankles had swollen, her head hurt, \\nand the heartburn was vicious that day. \"I am saying th at maybe you\\'ve misplaced it.\"  \\n  \"Misplaced it?\" Mariam pulled a drawer. The spatulas and knives inside it clanked. \"How \\nlong have you been here, a few months? I\\'ve lived in this house for nineteen years,  \\ndokhiarjo.  I have kept that spoon in  this drawer sin ce you were shitting your diapers.\"  \\n  \"Still,\" Laila said, on the brink now, teeth clenched, \"it\\'s possible you put it somewhere \\nand forgot.\"  \\n  \"And it’s possible  you hid it somewhere, to aggravate me.\"  \\n  \"You\\'re a sad, miserable woman,\" Laila said.  \\n \\n  Mariam flinched, then recovered, pursed her lips. \"And you\\'re a whore. A whore and a  \\ndozd. A  thieving whore, that\\'s what you are!\"  \\n  Then there was shouting  Pots raised though not hurled. They\\'d called each other names, \\nnames that made Laila blush now. They hadn\\'t spoken since. Laila was still shocked at how \\neasily she\\'d come unhinged, but, the truth was, part of her had liked it, had liked how it felt \\nto scream at Mariam, to curse at her, to have a target at which to focus all her simmering \\nanger, her grief.  \\n  Laila wondered, with something like insight, if it wasn\\'t the same for Mariam.  \\n  After, she had run upstairs and thrown herself on Rasheed\\'s bed. Downstairs, Mariam was \\nstill yelling, \"Dirt on  \\n  your head! Dirt on your head!\" Laila had lain on the bed, groaning into the pillow, missing \\nher parents suddenly and with an overpowering intensity she hadn\\'t felt since those terrible \\ndays just after the attack. She lay there, clutching handfuls of the bed sheet , until, suddenly, \\nher breath caught. She sat up, h ands shooting down to her belly.  \\n  The baby had just kicked for the first time.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

The girl was tottering f orward, \\nbent at the waist, one arm draped protectively across the taut drum of her belly, the shape of \\nwhich was visible through her burqa. Rasheed, anxious and overly attentive, was holding \\nher elbow, directing her across the yard like a traffic policeman . He made a  Wait here  \\ngesture, rushed to the front gate, then motioned for the girl to come forward, one foot \\npropping the gate open. When she reached him, he took her by the hand, helped her through \\nthe gate. Mariam could almost hear him say,  \"Watch your step, now, my flower,  my gul.\"  \\n  They came back early the next evening.  \\n  Mariam saw Rasheed enter the yard first. He let the gate go prematurely, and it almost hit \\nthe girl on the face. He crossed the yard in a few, quick steps. Mariam detected a shadow \\non his face, a darkness underlying the coppery light of dusk. In the house, he took off his \\ncoat, threw it on the couch. Brushing past Mariam, he said in a brusque voice, \"I\\'m hungry. \\nGet supper ready.\"  \\n  The front door to the house opened. From the hallway , Mariam saw the girl, a swaddled \\nbundle in the hook of her left arm. She had one foot outside, the other inside, against the \\ndoor, to prevent it from springing shut. She was stooped over and was grunting, trying to \\nreach for the paper bag of belongings th at she had put down in order to open the door. Her  \\nface was grimacing with effort. She looked up and saw Mariam.  \\n  Mariam turned around and went to the kitchen to warm Rasheed\\'s  meal.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  \"It’s like someone is ramming a screwdriver into my ear,\" Rash eed said, rubbing his eyes.  \\nHe was  standing in Mariam\\'s door, puffy eyed, wearing only a iumban  tied with a floppy \\nknot.  His white hair was straggly, pointing every which way. \"This crying. I can\\'t stand it.\"  \\n  Downstairs, the girl was walking the baby acro ss the floor, trying to sing to her.  \\n  \"I haven\\'t had a  decent night\\'s sleep in two months ,\" Rasheed said.  \"And the room smells \\nlike a sewer. There\\'s  shit cloths  lying all over the place. I stepped on one  just the  other \\nnight.\"  \\n  Mariam smirked inwardly wi th perverse pleasure.  \\n  \"Take her outside!\" Rasheed yelled over his shoulder. \"Can\\'t you take her outside?\"  \\n  The singing was suspended briefly. \"She\\'ll  catch pneumonia!\"  \\n  \"It\\'s summertime!\"  \\n \\n  \\'What?  \\n  Rasheed clenched his teeth and raised his voice. \"I s aid, It\\'s warm out!\"  \\n  \"I\\'m not taking her outside!\"  \\n  The singing resumed  \\n  \"Sometimes, I swear, sometimes I want to put that thing in a box and let her float down \\nKabul River.

It was always  the baby,  or, when he was really exasperated,  that thing.  \\n  Some nights, Mariam overheard them arguing. She tiptoed to their door, listened to him \\ncomplain about the baby always the baby the insist ent crying, the smells, the toys that made \\nhim trip, the way the baby had hijacked Laila\\'s attentions from him with constant demands \\nto be fed, burped, changed, walked, held. The girl, in turn, scolded him for smoking in the \\nroom, for not letting the baby sleep with them.  \\n  There were other arguments waged in voices pitched low.  \\n  \"The doctor said six weeks.\"  \\n \\n  \"Not yet, Rasheed. No. Let go. Come on. Don\\'t do that.\"  \\n  \"It\\'s been two months.\"  \\n  \"Ssht. There. You woke up the baby.\" Then more sharply,  \"Khosh shodi?  Happy now?\"  \\n  Mariam would sneak back to her room.  \\n  \"Can\\'t you help?\" Rasheed said now. \"There must be something you can do.\"  \\n  \"What do I know about babies?\" Mariam said.  \\n  \"Rasheed! Can you bring the bottle? It\\'s sitting on the  almari.  She won\\'t feed. I want to try \\nthe bottle again.\"  \\n  The baby\\'s screeching rose and fell like a cleaver on meat.  \\n  Rasheed closed his eyes. \"That thing is a warlord. Hekmatyar. I\\'m telling you, Laila\\'s \\ngiven birth to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mariam watched as t he girl\\'s days became consumed with cycles of feeding, rocking, \\nbouncing, walking. Even when the baby napped, there were soiled diapers to scrub and \\nleave to soak in a pail of the disinfectant that the girl had insisted Rasheed buy for her. \\nThere were fing ernails to trim with sandpaper, coveralls and pajamas to wash and hang to \\ndry. These clothes, like other things about the baby, became a point of contention.  \\n  \"What\\'s the matter with them?\" Rasheed said  \\n  \"They\\'re boys\\' clothes. For a  bacha\"  \\n  \"You think she knows the difference? I paid good money for those clothes. And another \\nthing, I don\\'t care for that tone. Consider that a warning.\"  \\n  Every week, without fail, the girl heated a black metal brazier over a flame, tossed a pinch \\nof wild rue seeds in it, and wafted the  espandi  smoke in her baby\\'s direction to ward off \\nevil. \\n  Mariam found it exhausting to watch the girl\\'s lolloping enthusiasm and had to admit, if \\nonly privately, to a degree of admiration. She marveled at how the girl\\'s eyes shone with \\nwors hip, even in the mornings when her face drooped and her complexion was waxy from a \\nnight\\'s worth of walking the baby. The girl had fits of laughter when the baby passed gas. \\nThe tiniest changes in the baby enchanted her, and everything it did was declared \\nspectacular.  \\n  \"Look! She\\'s reaching for the rattle. How clever she is.\"  \\n  \"I\\'ll call the newspapers,\" said Rasheed.  \\n  Every night, there were demonstrations.

Everything she said used to please him, intrigue him, \\nmake him look up from his plate and nod with approval.  \\n  The strange thing was, the girl\\'s fall from grace ought to have pleased Mariam, brought \\nher a sense of vindication. But it didn\\'t. It didn\\'t. To  her own surprise, Mariam found herself \\npitying the girl.  \\n  It was also over dinner that the girl let loose a steady stream of worries. Topping the list \\nwas pneumonia, which was suspected with every minor cough. Then there was dysentery, \\nthe specter of whi ch was raised with every loose stool. Every rash was either chicken pox \\nor measles.  \\n  \"You should not get so attached,\" Rasheed said one night.  \\n  \"What do you mean?\"  \\n  \"I was listening to the radio the other night. Voice of America. I heard an interesting \\nstatistic. They said that in Afghanistan one out of four children will die before the age of \\nfive. That\\'s what they said. Now, they What? What? Where are you going? Come back here. \\nGet back here this instant!\"  \\n \\n  He gave Mariam a bewildered look. \"What\\'s t he matter with her?\"  \\n  That night, Mariam was lying in bed when the bickering started again. It was a hot, dry \\nsummer night, typical of the month of  Saratan  in Kabul. Mariam had opened her window, \\nthen shut it when no breeze came through to temper the heat , only mosquitoes. She could \\nfeel the heat rising from the ground outside, through the wheat brown, splintered planks of \\nthe outhouse in the yard, up through the walls and into her room.  \\n  Usually, the bickering ran its course after a few minutes, but half  an hour passed and not \\nonly was it still going on, it was escalating. Mariam could hear Rasheed shouting now. The \\ngirl\\'s voice, underneath his, was tentative and shrill. Soon the baby was wailing.  \\n  Then Mariam heard their door open violently. In the morn ing, she would find the \\ndoorknob\\'s circular impression in the hallway wall. She was sitting up in bed when her own \\ndoor slammed open and Rasheed came through.  \\n  He was wearing white underpants and a matching undershirt, stained yellow in the \\nunderarms with  sweat. On his feet he wore flip flops. He held a belt in his hand, the brown \\nleather one he\\'d bought for his  nikka  with the girl, and was wrapping the perforated end \\naround his fist.  \\n  \"It\\'s your doing. I know it is,\" he snarled, advancing on her.  \\n  Maria m slid out of her bed and began backpedaling. Her arms instinctively crossed over \\nher chest, where he often struck her first.  \\n \\n  \"What are you talking about?\" she stammered.  \\n  \"Her denying me. You\\'re teaching her to.\"  \\n  Over the years, Mariam had learned t o harden herself against his scorn and reproach, his \\nridiculing and reprimanding. But this fear she had no control over. All these years and still \\nshe shivered with fright when he was like this, sneering, tightening the belt around his fist, \\nthe creaking o f the leather, the glint in his bloodshot eyes. It was the fear of the goat, \\nreleased in the tiger\\'s cage, when the tiger first looks up from its paws, begins to growl \\nNow the girl was in the room, her eyes wide, her face contorted  '),\n",

He swung the belt, \\ntesting it against his own thigh. The buckle jingled loudly.  \\n  \"Stop it,  basl\"  the girl said. \"Rasheed, you can\\'t do this.\"  \\n  \"Go back to the room.\"  \\n  Mariam backpedaled again.  \\n  \"No! Don\\'t  do this!\"  \\n  Now!  \\n \\n  Rasheed raised the belt again and this time came at Mariam.  \\n  Then an astonishing thing happened: The girl lunged at him. She grabbed his arm with \\nboth hands and tried to drag him down, but she could do no more than dangle from it. She  \\ndid succeed in slowing Rasheed\\'s progress toward Mariam.  \\n  \"Let go!\" Rasheed cried.  \\n  \"You win. You win. Don\\'t do this. Please, Rasheed, no beating! Please don\\'t do this.\"  \\n  They struggled like this, the girl hanging on, pleading, Rasheed trying to shake her off, \\nkeeping his eyes on Mariam, who was too stunned to do anything.  \\n  In the end, Mariam knew that there would be no beating, not that night. He\\'d made his \\npoint. He stayed that way a few moments longer, arm raised, chest heaving, a fine sheen of \\nswea t filming his brow. Slowly, Rasheed lowered his arm. The girl\\'s feet touched ground \\nand still she wouldn\\'t let go, as if she didn\\'t trust him. He had to yank his arm free of her \\ngrip. \\n  \"I\\'m on to you,\" he said, slinging the belt over his shoulder. \"I\\'m on  to you both. I won\\'t be \\nmade an  ahmaq,  a fool, in my own house.\"  \\n  He threw Mariam one last, murderous stare, and gave the girl a shove in the back on the \\nway out.  \\n \\n  When she heard their door close, Mariam climbed back into bed, buried her head beneath \\nthe pillow, and waited for the shaking to stop.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Three times that night, Mariam was awakened from sleep. The first time, it was the \\nrumble of rockets in the west, coming from the direction of Karteh Char. The second time, \\nit was the baby crying dow nstairs, the girl\\'s shushing, the clatter of spoon against milk \\nbottle. Finally, it was thirst that pulled her out of bed.  \\n  Downstairs, the living room was dark, save for a bar of moonlight spilling through the \\nwindow. Mariam could hear the buzzing of a f ly somewhere, could make out the outline of \\nthe cast iron stove in the corner, its pipe jutting up, then making a sharp angle just below \\nthe ceiling.  \\n  On her way to the kitchen, Mariam nearly tripped over something. There was a shape at \\nher feet. When her  eyes adjusted, she made out the girl and her baby lying on the floor on \\ntop of a quilt.  \\n  The girl was sleeping on her side, snoring. The baby was awake. Mariam lit the kerosene \\nlamp on the table and hunkered down. In the light, she had her first real clo se up look at the \\nbaby, the tuft of dark hair, the thick lashed hazel eyes, the pink cheeks, and lips the color of \\nripe pomegranate.  '),\n",

She was lying on her \\nback, her head tilted sideways, looki ng at Mariam intently with a mixture of amusement, \\nconfusion, and suspicion. Mariam wondered if her face might frighten her, but then the \\nbaby squealed happily and Mariam knew that a favorable judgment had been passed on her \\nbehalf.  \\n  \"Shh, \" Mariam whisper ed \"You\\'ll wake up your mother, half deaf as she is.\"  \\n  The baby\\'s hand balled into a fist. It rose, fell, found a spastic path to her mouth. Around a \\nmouthful of her own hand, the baby gave Mariam a grin, little bubbles of spittle shining on \\nher lips.  \\n  \"Look at you. What a sorry sight you are, dressed like a damn boy. And all bundled up in \\nthis heat. No wonder you\\'re still awake.\"  \\n  Mariam pulled the blanket off the baby, was horrified to find a second one beneath, \\nclucked her tongue, and pulled that one off too. The baby giggled with relief. She flapped \\nher arms like a bird.  \\n  \"Better,  nay? \" \\n  As Mariam was pulling back, the baby grabbed her pinkie. The tiny fingers curled \\nthemselves tightly around it. They felt warm and soft, moist with drool.  \\n  \"Gunuh, \" the baby said.  \\n  \"All right, Ms; let go.\"  \\n  The baby hung on, kicked her legs again.  \\n \\n  Mariam pulled her finger free. The baby smiled and made a series of gurgling sounds. The \\nknuckles went back to the mouth.  \\n  \"What are you so happy about? Huh? What ar e you smiling at? You\\'re not so clever as \\nyour mother says. You have a brute for a father and a fool for a mother. You wouldn\\'t smile \\nso much if you knew. No you wouldn\\'t. Go to sleep, now. Go on.\"  \\n  Mariam rose to her feet and walked a few steps before th e baby started making the eh, eh, \\neh sounds that Mariam knew signaled the onset of a hearty cry. She retraced her steps.  \\n  \"What is it? What do you want from  me?\"  \\n  The baby grinned toothlessly.  \\n  Mariam sighed. She sat down and let her finger be grabbed, l ooked on as the baby \\nsqueaked, as she flexed her plump legs at the hips and kicked air. Mariam sat there, \\nwatching, until the baby stopped moving and began snoring softly.  \\n  Outside, mockingbirds were singing blithely, and, once in a while, when the songst ers \\ntook flight, Mariam could see their wings catching the phosphorescent blue of moonlight \\nbeaming through the clouds. And though her throat was parched with thirst and her feet \\nburned with pins and needles, it was a long time before Mariam gently freed h er finger \\nfrom the baby\\'s grip and got up.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

Laila told her of his aptitude for solving riddles, his trickery and \\nmischief, his easy laugh.  \\n  \"He had the prettiest lashes, thick like yours. A good chin, a fine nose, and a round \\nforehead. Oh, your father was handsome, Aziza. He was perfect . Perfect, like you are.\"  \\n  But she was careful never to mention him by name.  \\n  Sometimes she caught Rasheed looking at Aziza in the most peculiar way. The other night, \\nsitting on the bedroom floor, where he was shaving a corn from his foot, he said quite \\ncasually, \"So what was it like between you two?\"  \\n  Laila had given him a puzzled look, as though she didn\\'t understand.  \\n  \"Laili and Majnoon. You and the y akknga,  the cripple. What was it you had, he and you?\"  \\n \\n  \"He was my friend,\" she said, careful that her voice not shift too much in key.  She busied \\nherself  making a bottle. \"You know that.\"  \\n  \"I don\\'t know  what  I know.\"  Rasheed deposited the shavings on the windowsill and \\ndropped onto the bed. The springs protested with a loud creak. He splayed his legs, picked \\nat his crotch. \"And as… .friends,  did the two of you ever do anything out of order?\"  \\n  \"Out of order?\"  \\n  Rasheed smiled lightheartedly, but Laila could feel his gaze, cold and watchful. \"Let me \\nsee, now. Well, did he  ever give you  a kiss? Maybe  put his hand where it did n\\'t belong?\"  \\n  Laila winced with, she hoped, an indignant air. She could feel her heart drumming in her \\nthroat. \"He was like  a brother  to me.\"  \\n  \"So he was a friend or a brother?\"  \\n  \"Both.

Some weeks, if the wallet was light, she took only a \\nfive-afghan bill, or nothing at all, for fear that he would notice. When the wallet was plump, \\nshe helped  herself  to a ten or a  twent y, once even risking two twenties. She hid the money \\nin a pouch  she’d  sewn in the lining of her checkered winter coat.  \\n \\n  She wondered what he would do if he knew that she was planning to run away next spring. \\nNext summer at the latest. Laila hoped to have  a thousand afghanis or more stowed away, \\nhalf of which would go to the bus fare from Kabul to Peshawar. She would pawn her \\nwedding ring when the time drew close, as well as the other jewelry that Rasheed had given \\nher the year before when she was still th e malika  of his palace.  \\n  \"Anyway,\" he said at last, fingers drumming his belly, \"I can\\'t be blamed. I am a husband. \\nThese are the things a husband wonders. But he\\'s lucky he died the way he did. Because if \\nhe was here now, if I got my hands on him…\" He su cked through his teeth and shook his \\nhead.  \\n  \"What happened to not speaking ill of the dead?\"  \\n  \"I guess some people can\\'t be dead enough,\" he said.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Two days later, Laila woke up in the morning and found a stack of baby clothes, neatly \\nfolded, ou tside her bedroom door. There was a twirl dress with little pink fishes sewn \\naround the bodice, a blue floral wool dress with matching socks and mittens, yellow \\npajamas with carrot colored polka dots, and green cotton pants with a dotted ruffle on the \\ncuff. \\n  \"There is a rumor,\" Rasheed said over dinner that night, smacking his lips, taking no \\nnotice of Aziza or the pajamas Laila had put on her, \"that Dostum is going to change sides \\nand join Hekmatyar. Massoud will have his hands full then, fighting those t wo. And we \\nmustn\\'t forget the Hazaras.\" He took a pinch of the pickled eggplant Mariam had made that \\nsummer. \"Let\\'s hope it\\'s just that, a rumor. Because if that happens, this war,\" he waved one \\ngreasy hand, \"will seem like a Friday picnic at Paghman.\"  \\n  Later, he mounted her and relieved himself with wordless haste, fully dressed save for his  \\ntumban,  not removed but pulled down to the ankles. When the frantic rocking was over, he \\nrolled off her and was asleep in minutes.  \\n  Laila slipped out of the bedroom and found Mariam in the kitchen squatting, cleaning a \\npair of trout. A pot of rice was already soaking beside her. The kitchen smelled like cumin \\nand smoke, browned onions and fish.  \\n  Laila sat in a comer and draped her knees with the hem of her dress.  \\n  \"Thank you,\" she said.  \\n  Mariam took no notice of her. She finished cutting up the first trout and picked up the \\nsecond. With a serrated knife, she clipped the fins, then turned the fish over, its underbelly \\nfacing her, and sliced it expertly from the tail to the gills. Laila watched her put her thumb \\ninto its mouth, just over the lower jaw, push it in, and, in one downward stroke, remove the \\ngills and the entrails.  \\n  \"The clothes are lovely.\"  \\n  \"I had no use for them,\" Mariam muttered.

I used to  catch  my own  fish.\"  \\n  \"I\\'ve nev er fished\"  \\n  \"Not much to  it. It\\'s mostly waiting.\"  \\n  Laila  watched her cut the gutted trout into thirds. \"Did you sew the clothes yourself?\"  \\n  Mariam nodded.  \\n  \"When?\"  \\n  Mariam  rinsed sections of fish  in a bowl of water. \"When I was pregnant the first tim e. Or \\nmaybe the second time. Eighteen, nineteen years ago. Long time, anyhow. Like I said, I \\nnever had any  use for them.\"  \\n  \"You\\'re a really good  khayai.  Maybe you can teach me.\"  \\n  Mariam placed the rinsed chunks of trout into a clean bowl.  Drops  of water dripping  from  \\nher fingertips,  she raised her head and looked at Laila, looked at her  as if for the first  time.  \\n  \"The other night, when he…Nobody\\'s ever stood up for me before ,\" she said.  \\n \\n  Laila examined Mariam\\'s drooping cheeks, the eyelids that sagged in tired folds, the deep \\nlines that framed her mouth she saw these things as though she too were looking at \\nsomeone for the first time. And, for the first time, it was not an adversary\\'s face Laila saw \\nbut a face of grievances unspoken, burdens gone unprot ested, a destiny submitted to and \\nendured. If she stayed, would this be her own face, Laila wondered, twenty years from \\nnow?  \\n  \"I couldn\\'t let him,\" Laila said \"I wasn\\'t raised in a household where people did things like \\nthat.\"  \\n  \"This  is your household no w. You ought to get used to it.\"  \\n  \"Not to/to I won\\'t.\"  \\n  \"He\\'ll turn on you too, you know,\" Mariam said, wiping her hands dry with a rag. \"Soon \\nenough. And you gave him a daughter.

Laila sensed anxiety in the way she tugged at her \\nsleeves, adjusted her  hijab,  pushed back a curl of hair.  \\n  \"The Chi nese say it\\'s better to be deprived of food for three days than tea for one.\"  \\n  Mariam gave a half smile. \"It\\'s a good saying.\"  \\n  \"It is.\"  \\n  \"But I can\\'t stay long.\"  \\n  \"One cup.\"  \\n  They sat on folding chairs outside and ate  halwa  with their fingers from a common bowl.

They sat in the kitchen \\nand rolled dough, chopped green onions, minced garlic, offered bits of cucumber to \\nAziza, who banged spoons nearby and played with carrots. In the  yard, Aziza lay in a \\nwicker bassinet, dressed in layers of clothing, a winter muffler wrapped snugly around her \\nneck. Mariam and Laila kept a watchful eye on her as they did the wash, Mariam\\'s knuckles \\nbumping Laila\\'s as they scrubbed shirts and trousers and diapers.  \\n  Mariam slowly grew accustomed to this tentative but pleasant companionship. She was \\neager for the three cups of  chai she and Laila would share in the yard, a nightly ritual now. \\nIn the mornings, Mariam found herself looking forward to the so und of Laila\\'s cracked \\nslippers slapping the steps as she came down for breakfast and to the tinkle of Aziza\\'s shrill \\nlaugh, to the sight of her eight little teeth, the milky scent of her skin. If Laila and Aziza \\nslept in, Mariam became anxious waiting. Sh e washed dishes that didn\\'t need washing. She \\nrearranged cushions in the living room. She dusted clean windowsills. She kept herself \\noccupied until Laila entered the kitchen, Aziza hoisted on her hip.  \\n  When Aziza first spotted Mariam in the morning, her e yes always sprang open, and she \\nbegan mewling and squirming in her mother\\'s grip. She thrust her arms toward Mariam, \\ndemanding to be held, her tiny hands opening and closing urgently, on her face a look of \\nboth adoration and quivering anxiety.  \\n \\n  \"What a s cene you\\'re making,\" Laila would say, releasing her to crawl toward Mariam. \\n\"What a scene! Calm down. Khala Mariam isn\\'t going anywhere. There she is, your aunt. \\nSee? Go on, now.\"  \\n  As soon as she was in Mariam\\'s arms, Aziza\\'s thumb shot into her mouth and  she buried \\nher face in Mariam\\'s neck.  \\n  Mariam bounced her stiffly, a half bewildered, half grateful smile on her lips. Mariam had \\nnever before been wanted like this. Love had never been declared to her so guilelessly, so \\nunreservedly.  \\n  Aziza made Mariam  want to weep.  \\n  \"Why have you pinned your little heart to an old, ugly hag like me?\" Mariam would \\nmurmur into Aziza\\'s hair. \"Huh? I am nobody, don\\'t you see? A  dehatl  What have I got to \\ngive you?\"  \\n  But Aziza only muttered contentedly and dug her face in deeper. And when she did that, \\nMariam swooned.

From either side of the Kabul River, they released \\nrounds of artillery at each other. The streets became littered with bodies, glass, and \\ncrumpled chunks of metal. The re was looting, murder, and, increasingly, rape, which was \\nused to intimidate civilians and reward militiamen. Mariam heard of women who were \\nkilling themselves out of fear of being raped, and of men who, in the name of honor, would \\nkill their wives or dau ghters if they\\'d been raped by the militia.  \\n  Aziza shrieked at the thumping of mortars. To distract her, Mariam arranged grains of rice \\non the floor, in the shape of a house or a rooster or a star, and let Aziza scatter them. She \\ndrew elephants for Aziza the way Jalil had shown her, in one stroke, without ever lifting the \\ntip of the pen.  \\n  Rasheed said civilians were getting killed daily, by the dozens. Hospitals and stores \\nholding medical supplies were getting shelled. Vehicles carrying emergency food sup plies \\nwere being barred from entering the city, he said, raided, shot at. Mariam wondered if there \\nwas fighting like this in Herat too, and, if so, how Mullah Faizullah was coping, if he was \\nstill alive, and Bibijo too, with all her sons, brides, and grand children. And, of course, Jalil. \\nWas \\n  he hiding out, Mariam wondered, as she was? Or had he taken his wives and children and \\nfled the country? She hoped Jalil was somewhere safe, that he\\'d managed to get away from \\nall of this killing.  \\n  For a week, the fi ghting forced even Rasheed to stay home. He locked the door to the yard, \\nset booby traps, locked the front door too and barricaded it with the couch. He paced the \\nhouse, smoking, peering out the window, cleaning his gun, loading and loading it again. \\nTwice , he fired his weapon into the street claiming he\\'d seen someone trying to climb the \\nwall.  \\n  \"They\\'re forcing young boys to join,\" he said. \"The  Mujahideen  are. In plain daylight, at \\ngunpoint. They drag boys right off the streets. And when soldiers from a rival militia \\ncapture these boys, they torture them.

And you can stop twirling \\nyour wrists like that. I\\'m not picking you up. Go on! Go on before you get stepped on.\"  \\n  Aziza flinched. She crawled back to Mariam, looking bruised and confused. In Mariam\\'s \\nlap, she sucked her thumb cheerlessly and watched Rasheed in a sullen, pensive way. \\nOccasionally, she looked up, Mariam imagined, with a look of wanting to be reassured.  \\n  But when it came to father s, Mariam had no assurances to give.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Maeiam was relieved when the fighting subsided again, mostly because they no longer \\nhad to be cooped up with Rasheed, with his sour temper infecting the household.

Mariam had stuffed it with beans, made it \\na dress with tea dyed fabric and a necklace with tiny empty thread spools through which \\nshe\\'d threaded a string.  \\n  Then Aziza passed gas in her sleep.

They \\nlaughed like this, at each other\\'s reflection in the mirror, their eyes tearing, and the moment \\nwas so natural, so effortless, that suddenly Mariam started telling her about Jalil, and Nana, \\nand the jinn.  Laila s tood with her hands idle on Mariam\\'s shoulders, eyes locked on \\nMariam\\'s face in the mirror.

But Mariam \\nhad hardly noticed, hardly cared. She had passed these years in a distant corner of her mind \\nA dry, barren field, out beyond wish and lament, bey ond dream and disillusionment  \\nThere, the future did not matter. And the past held only this wisdom: that love was a \\ndamaging mistake, and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those \\ntwin poisonous flowers began to sprout in the parche d land of that field, Mariam uprooted \\nthem. She uprooted them and ditched them before they took hold.  \\n  But somehow, over these last months, Laila and Aziza a harami  like herself, as it turned \\nout had become extensions of her, and now, without them, the lif e Mariam had tolerated for \\nso long suddenly seemed intolerable.  \\n  We\\'re leaving this spring, Aziza and I. Come with us, Mariam.  \\n  The years had not been kind to Mariam. But perhaps, she thought, there were kinder years \\nwaiting still. A new life, a life in which she would find the blessings that Nana had said a  \\nharami  like her would never see. Two new flowers had unexpectedly sprouted in her life, \\nand, as Mariam watched the snow coming down, she pictured Mullah Faizullah twirling his  \\niasbeh  beads, leaning in  and whispering to her in his soft, tremulous voice,  But it is God \\nWho has planted them, Mariam jo. And it is His will that you tend to them. It is His will, my \\ngirl. \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

She watched him pedal away, a \\nbig man on a small bicycle, the morning sun glaring off the handlebars.  \\n  \"Laila?\"  \\n  Mariam was in the doorway. Laila could tell that she hadn\\'t slept either.

Ona\"  \\n  Everywhere she looked, Laila saw Rasheed.

Laila wished she could see her face, but \\nMariam was in burqa they both were and all she could see was the glitter of her eyes \\nthrough the grid.  \\n  This was Laila\\'s first time out of the house in weeks, discounting the short trip to the \\npawnshop the day before whe re she had pushed her wedding ring across a glass counter, \\nwhere she\\'d walked out thrilled by the finality of it, knowing there was no going back.  \\n  All around her now, Laila saw the consequences of the recent fighting whose sounds she\\'d \\nheard from the hou se. Homes that lay in roofless ruins of brick and jagged stone, gouged \\nbuildings with fallen beams poking through the holes, the charred, mangled husks of cars, \\nupended, sometimes stacked on top of each other, walls pocked by holes of every \\nconceivable cal iber, shattered glass everywhere. She saw a funeral procession marching \\ntoward a mosque, a black clad old woman at the rear tearing at her hair.

Men in turbans were busy heaving bun dles and crates onto bus \\ntops, securing suitcases down with ropes. Inside the station, men stood in a long line at the \\nticket booth. Burqa clad women stood in groups and chatted, their belongings piled at their \\nfeet. Babies were bounced, children scolded f or straying too far.  \\n  Mujahideen militiamen patrolled the station and the curbside, barking curt orders here and \\nthere. They wore boots,  pakols,  dusty green fatigues. They all carried Kalashnikovs.  \\n  Laila felt watched. She looked no one in the face, but she felt as though every person in \\nthis place knew, that they were looking on with disapproval at what she and Mariam were \\ndoing.  \\n  \"Do you see anybody?\" Laila asked.  \\n  Mariam shifted Aziza in her arms. \"I\\'m looking.\"  \\n \\n  This, Laila had known, would be the  first risky part, finding a man suitable to pose with \\nthem as a family member. The freedoms and opportunities that women had enjoyed \\nbetween 1978 and 1992 were a thing of the past now  Laila could still remember Babi \\nsaying of those years of communist rul e, It\\'s a good time to be a woman in Afghanistan, \\nLaila  Since the Mujahideen takeover in April 1992, Afghanistan\\'s name had been changed \\nto the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The Supreme Court under Rabbani was filled now with \\nhard liner mullahs who did awa y with the communist era decrees that empowered women \\nand instead passed rulings based on Shari\\'a, strict Islamic laws that ordered women to cover, \\nforbade their travel without a male relative, punished adultery with stoning. Even if the \\nactual enforcement  of these laws was sporadic at best.  But they\\'d enforce them on us more,  \\nLaila had said to Mariam,  if they weren\\'t so busy killing each other. And us.  \\n  The second risky part of this trip would come when they actually arrived in Pakistan. \\nAlready burdened with nearly two million Afghan refugees, Pakistan had closed its borders \\nto Afghans in January of that year. Laila had heard that only those with visas would be \\nadmitted. But the border was porous always had been and Laila knew that thousands of \\nAfghans we re still crossing into Pakistan either with bribes or by proving humanitarian \\ngrounds  and there were always smugglers who could be hired.  We\\'ll find a way when we \\nget there,  she\\'d told Mariam.  \\n  \"How about him?\" Mariam said, motioning with her chin.  \\n  \"He doesn\\'t look trustworthy.\"  \\n  \"And him?\"  \\n  \"Too old. And he\\'s traveling with two other men.\"  \\n \\n  Eventually,  Laila found him sitting outside on a park bench,  with a veiled  woman at his \\nside and a little boy in a skullcap, roughly Aziza\\'s age, bouncing on hi s knees.  He was tall \\nand slender, bearded, wearing an open collared  shirt and a modest gray coat with missing \\nbuttons.  \\n  \"Wait here,\"  she said to  Mariam. Walking away, she again heard Mariam muttering a \\nprayer.  \\n  When Laila approached the young man, he loo ked up, shielded the sun from his eyes with \\na hand.  \\n  \"Forgive me, brother, but are you going to Peshawar?\"  '),\n",

Can you do us a favor?\"  \\n  He passed the boy to his wife. He and Laila stepped away.  \\n  \"What is it,  hamshira ? \" \\n  She was encouraged to see that he had soft eyes, a kind face.  \\n  She told him the story that she and Mariam had agreed on. She was a  biwa,  she said,  a \\nwidow. She and her mother and daughter had no one  left in Kabul.  They were going  to \\nPeshawar to stay with her uncle.  \\n \\n  \"You want to come with my family,\" the young man said  \\n  \"I know it\\'s  zahmat  for you. But you look like a decent brother, and I \"  \\n  \"Don\\'t worry,  hamshira  I understand. It\\'s no trouble. Let me go and buy your tickets. \" \\n  \"Thank you, brother. This is  sawab,  a good deed. God will remember.\"  \\n  She fished the envelope from her pocket beneath the burqa and passed it to him. In it was \\neleven hundred afghanis, or about half of the money she\\'d stashed over the past year plus \\nthe sale of the ring. He slipped the envelope in his trouser pocket.  \\n  \"Wait here.\"  \\n  She watched him enter the station. He returned half an hour later.  \\n  \"It\\'s best I hold on to your tickets,\" he said. The bus leaves in one hour, at eleven. We\\'ll all \\nboard  together. My name is Wakil. If they ask and they shouldn\\'t I\\'ll tell them you\\'re my \\ncousin.\"  \\n  Laila gave him their names, and he said he would remember.  \\n  \"Stay close,\" he said.  \\n \\n  They sat on the bench adjacent to Wakil and his family\\'s. It was a sunny,  warm morning, \\nthe sky streaked only by a few wispy clouds hovering in the distance over the hills.  Mariam \\nbegan feeding Aziza a few of the crackers she\\'d remembered to bring in their rush to pack. \\nShe offered one to Laila.  \\n  \"I\\'ll throw  up,\" Laila laughed.  \"I\\'m too excited.\"  \\n  \"Me too.\"  \\n  \"Thank  you, Mariam.\"  \\n  \"For what?\"  \\n  \"For this.  For coming with us,\" Laila said. \"I don\\'t think I could do this alone.\"  \\n  \"You won\\'t have to.\"  \\n  \"We\\'re going to be all right, aren\\'t we, Mariam, where we\\'re going?\"  \\n  Mariam \\'s hand slid across the bench and closed over hers. \"The Koran says Allah is the \\nEast and the West, therefore wherever you turn there is Allah\\'s purpose.\"  \\n  \"Bov!\" Aziza cried, pointing to a bus. \"Mayam,  bov\" \\n \\n  \"I see it, Aziza jo,\" Mariam said. \"That\\'s ri ght, bov. Soon we\\'re all going to ride on a  bov. \\nOh, the things you\\'re going to see.\"  \\n  Laila smiled. She watched a carpenter in his shop across the street sawing wood, sending \\nchips flying. She watched the cars bolting past, their windows coated with soot  and grime. \\nShe watched the buses growling idly at the curb, with peacocks, lions, rising suns, and \\nglittery swords painted on their sides.  \\n  In the warmth of the morning sun, Laila felt giddy and bold.

The bus doors opened with a violent hydraulic hiss. A parad e of \\ntravelers rushed toward it, scampering past each other to squeeze through.  \\n  Wakil motioned toward Laila as he picked up his son.  \\n  \"We\\'re going,\" Laila said.  \\n  Wakil led the way. As they approached the bus, Laila saw faces appear in the windows, \\nnoses and palms pressed to the glass. All around them, farewells were yelled.  \\n  A young militia soldier was checking tickets at the bus door.  \\n \\n  \"Bov!\" A ziza cried.  \\n  Wakil handed tickets to the soldier, who tore them in half and handed them back. Wakil \\nlet hi s wife board first. Laila saw a look pass between Wakil and the militiaman. Wakil, \\nperched on the first step of the bus, leaned down and said something in his ear. The \\nmilitiaman nodded.  \\n  Laila\\'s heart plummeted.  \\n  \"You two, with the child, step aside,\" t he soldier said.  \\n  Laila pretended not to hear. She went to climb the steps, but he grabbed her by the \\nshoulder and roughly pulled her out of the line. \"You too,\" he called to Mariam. \"Hurry up! \\nYou\\'re holding up the line.\"  \\n  \"What\\'s the problem, brother?\"  Laila said through numb lips. \"We have tickets. Didn\\'t my \\ncousin hand them to you?\"  \\n  He made a  Shh motion with his finger and spoke in a low voice to another guard. The \\nsecond guard, a rotund fellow with a scar down his right cheek, nodded.  \\n  \"Follow me, \" this one said to Laila.  \\n  \"We have to board this bus,\" Laila cried, aware that her voice was shaking. \"We have \\ntickets. Why are you doing this?\"  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re not going to get on this bus. You might as well accept that. You will follow me. \\nUnless you want y our little girl to see you dragged.\"  \\n  As they were led to a truck, Laila looked over her shoulder and spotted Wakil\\'s boy at the \\nrear of the bus. The boy saw her too and waved happily.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  At the police station at Torabaz Khan Intersection, they wer e made to sit apart, on \\nopposite ends of a long, crowded corridor, between them a desk, behind which a man \\nsmoked one cigarette after another and clacked occasionally on a typewriter.

He stared at Laila, bouncing a pencil b y the eraser end on the \\ndesk.  \\n  \"We know,\" he began, clearing his throat and politely covering his mouth with a fist, \"that \\nyou have already told one lie today,  kamshira  The young man at the station was not your \\ncousin. He told us as much himself.

You don\\'t.\"  \\n  \"She was raised in Herat, I was born here in Kabul.\"  \\n  \"Of course. And you are widowed? You said you were. My condolences. And this uncle, \\nthis kaka,  where does he live?\"  \\n  \"In Peshawar.\"  \\n  \"Yes, you said that.\" He licked the poi nt of his pencil and poised it over a blank sheet of \\npaper. \"But where in Peshawar? Which neighborhood, please? Street name, sector \\nnumber.\"  \\n  Laila tried to push back the bubble of panic that was coming up her chest. She gave him \\nthe name of the only stre et she knew in Peshawar she\\'d heard it mentioned once, at the \\nparty Mammy had thrown when the Mujahideen had first come to Kabul \"Jamrud Road.\"  \\n \\n  \"Oh, yes. Same street as the Pearl Continental Hotel. He might have mentioned it.\"  \\n  Laila seized this opport unity and said he had. \"That very same street, yes.\"  \\n  \"Except the hotel is on Khyber Road.\"  \\n  Laila could hear Aziza crying in the corridor. \"My daughter\\'s frightened. May I get her, \\nbrother?\"  \\n  \"I prefer \\'Officer.\\' And you\\'ll be with her shortly. Do you have a telephone number for this \\nuncle?\"  \\n  \"I do. I did. I…\" Even with the burqa between them, Laila was not buffered from his \\npenetrating eyes. \"I\\'m so upset, I seem to have forgotten it.\"  \\n  He sighed through his nose. He asked for the uncle\\'s name, his w ife\\'s name. How many \\nchildren did he have? What were their names? Where did he work? How old was he? His \\nquestions left Laila flustered.  \\n  He put down his pencil, laced his fingers together, and leaned forward the way parents do \\nwhen they want to convey so mething to a toddler. \"You do realize,  hamshira,  that it is a \\ncrime for a woman to run away. We see a lot of it. Women traveling alone, claiming their \\nhusbands have died. Sometimes they\\'re telling the truth, most times not.

When it benefits the man. And isn\\'t this a \\'private family matter,\\' as \\nyou say?

I must say,  hamshira,  that you have made a very poor case for \\nyourself. Very poor indeed. Now, if you would wait outside I will have a few words with \\nyour…whoever she is.\"  \\n  Laila began to protest, then to yell, and he had to summon the help of two more m en to \\nhave her dragged out of his office.  \\n  Mariam\\'s interview lasted only a few minutes. When she came out, she looked shaken.  \\n  \"He asked so many questions,\" she said. \"I\\'m sorry, Laila jo. I am not smart like you. He \\nasked so many questions, I didn\\'t kn ow the answers.

Laila and \\nMariam were made to wai t in the backseat, guarded by a Mujahid soldier in the passenger \\nseat.

She tried to breathe again \\nand could only make a husky, choking sound. Dribble hung from her mouth.  \\n  Then she was being dragged by the hair. She saw Aziza lifted, saw her sandals slip off, her \\ntiny feet kicking. Hair was ripped from Laila\\'s scalp, and her eyes watered with pain. She \\nsaw his foot kick open the door to Mariam\\'s room, saw Aziza flung onto the bed. He let go \\nof Laila\\'s hair, and she felt the toe of his shoe connect with her left buttock. She howled \\nwith pain as he slammed the door shut. A key rattled in the lock.  \\n  Aziza wa s still screaming. Laila lay curled up on the floor, gasping. She pushed herself up \\non her hands, crawled to where Aziza lay on the bed. She reached for her daughter.  \\n  Downstairs, the beating began. To Laila, the sounds she heard were those of a methodica l, \\nfamiliar proceeding. There was no cursing, no screaming, no pleading, no surprised yelps, \\nonly the systematic business of beating and being beaten, the  thump, thump  of something \\nsolid repeatedly striking flesh, something, someone, hitting a wall with a thud, cloth ripping. \\nNow and then, Laila heard running footsteps, a wordless chase, furniture turning over, glass \\nshattering, then the thumping once more.  \\n  Laila took Aziza in her arms. A warmth spread down the front of her dress when Aziza\\'s \\nbladder let go. \\n  Downstairs, the running and chasing finally stopped. There was a sound now like a \\nwooden club repeatedly slapping a side of beef.  \\n  Laila rocked Aziza until the sounds stopped, and, when she heard the screen door creak \\nopen and slam shut, she lowered  Aziza to the ground and peeked out the window. She saw \\nRasheed leading Mariam across the yard by the nape of her neck. Mariam was barefoot and \\ndoubled over. There was blood on his hands, blood on Mariam\\'s face, her hair, down her \\nneck and back. Her shirt had been ripped down the front.  \\n  \"I\\'m so sorry, Mariam,\" Laila cried into the glass.  \\n \\n  She watched him shove Mariam into the toolshed. He went in, came out with a hammer \\nand several long planks of wood. He shut the double doors to the shed, took a key fr om his \\npocket, worked the padlock. He tested the doors, then went around the back of the shed and \\nfetched a ladder.  \\n  A few minutes later, his face was in Laila\\'s window, nails tucked in the comer of his \\nmouth. His hair was disheveled. There was a swath of  blood on his brow. At the sight of \\nhim, Aziza shrieked and buried her face in Laila\\'s armpit.  \\n  Rasheed began nailing boards across the window.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The dark was total, impenetrable and constant, without layer or texture. Rasheed had filled \\nthe crack s between the boards with something, put a large and immovable object at the foot \\nof the door so no light came from under it. Something had been stuffed in the keyhole.  \\n  Laila found it impossible to tell the passage of time with her eyes, so she did it wi th her \\ngood ear.  Azan  and crowing roosters signaled morning. The sounds of plates clanking in the \\nkitchen downstairs, the radio playing, meant evening.  \\n  The first day, they groped and fumbled for each other in the dark. Laila couldn\\'t see Aziza \\nwhen she c ried, when she went crawling.  '),\n",

You just be patient. Be a good, patient little girl for \\nMammy, and  I\\'ll get you some  aishee.  \" \\n  Laila sang her a few songs.  \\n  Azan  rang out a second time and still Rasheed had not given them any food, and, worse, \\nno water. That day, a thick, suffocating heat fell on them. The room turned into a pressure \\ncooker. Laila dr agged a dry tongue over her lips, thinking of the well outside, the water \\ncold and fresh. Aziza kept crying, and Laila noticed with alarm that when she wiped her \\ncheeks her hands came back dry. She stripped the clothes off Aziza, tried to find something \\nto fan her with, settled for blowing on her until she became light headed. Soon, Aziza \\nstopped crawling around. She slipped in and out of sleep.  \\n  Several times that day, Laila banged her fists against the walls, used up her energy \\nscreaming for help, hoping  that a neighbor would hear. But no one came, and her shrieking \\nonly frightened Aziza, who began to cry again, a weak, croaking sound. Laila slid to the \\nground. She thought guiltily of Mariam, beaten and bloodied, locked in this heat in the \\ntoolshed.  \\n  Laila fell asleep at some point, her body baking in the heat. She had a dream that she and \\nAziza had run into Tariq. He was across a crowded street from them, beneath the awning of \\na tailor\\'s shop. He was sitting on his haunches and sampling from a crate of f igs. That\\'s \\nyour father,  Laila said.  That man there, you see him? He\\'s your real  baba. She called his \\nname, but the street noise drowned her voice, and Tariq didn\\'t hear.  \\n \\n  She woke up to the whistling of rockets streaking overhead. Somewhere, the sky she  \\ncouldn\\'t see erupted with blasts and the long, frantic hammering of machine gun fire. Laila \\nclosed her eyes. She woke again to Rasheed\\'s heavy footsteps in the hallway. She dragged \\nherself to the door, slapped her palms against it.  \\n  \"Just one glass, Rash eed. Not for me. Do it for her. You don\\'t want her blood on your \\nhands.\" He walked past She began to plead with him. She begged for forgiveness, made \\npromises. She cursed him. His door closed. The radio came on.  \\n  The muezzin called  azan  a third time. Agai n the heat. Aziza became even more listless. \\nShe stopped crying, stopped moving altogether.  \\n  Laila put her ear over Aziza\\'s mouth, dreading each time that she would not hear the \\nshallow whooshing of breath. Even this simple act of lifting herself made her  head swim. \\nShe fell asleep, had dreams she could not remember.

She ran to the living room, found Laila already at the \\nwindow, Aziza mounted on her shoulders. Laila turned and smiled.  \\n  \"The Taliban are here ,\" she said.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mariam had first heard of the Taliban two years before, in October 1994, when Rasheed \\nhad brought home news that they had overthrown the warlords in Kandahar and taken the \\ncity. They were a guerrilla force, he said, made up of young Pashtun men whose families \\nhad fled to Pakistan during the war against the Soviets. Most of them had been raised some \\neven born in refugee camps along the Pakistani border, and in Pakistani madrasas, where \\nthey were schooled in  Shari\\'a  by mullahs. Their le ader was a mysterious, illiterate, one \\neyed recluse named Mullah Omar, who, Rasheed said with some amusement, called \\nhimself  Ameer ul Mumineeny  Leader of the Faithful.  \\n  \"It\\'s true that these boys have no  risha,  no roots,\" Rasheed said, addressing neither \\nMariam nor Laila. Ever since the failed escape, two and a half years ago, Mariam knew that \\nshe and Laila had become one and the same being to him, equally wretched, equally \\ndeserving of his distrust, his disdain and disregard. When he spoke, Mariam had the  sense \\nthat he was having a conversation with himself, or with some invisible presence in the \\nroom, who, unlike her and Laila, was worthy of his opinions.  \\n  \"They may have no past,\" he said, smoking and looking up at the ceiling. \"They may \\nknow nothing of the world or this country\\'s history. Yes. And, compared to them, Mariam \\nhere might as well be a university professor. Ha! All  \\n  true. But look around you. What do you see? Corrupt, greedy Mujahideen commanders, \\narmed to the teeth, rich off heroin, declarin g jihad on one another and killing everyone in \\nbetween that\\'s what. At least the Taliban are pure and incorruptible. At least they\\'re decent \\nMuslim boys. Wallah,  when they come, they will clean up this place. They\\'ll bring peace \\nand order. People won\\'t get shot anymore going out for milk. No more rockets! Think of \\nit.\" \\n  For two years now, the Taliban had been making their way toward Kabul, taking cities \\nfrom the Mujahideen, ending factional war wherever they\\'d settled. They had captured the \\nHazara commander  Abdul Ali Mazari and executed him. For months, they\\'d settled in the \\nsouthern outskirts of Kabul, firing on the city, exchanging rockets with Ahmad Shah \\nMassoud. Earlier in that September of 1996, they had captured the cities of Jalalabad and \\nSarobi.  \\n  The Taliban had one thing the Mujahideen did not, Rasheed said. They were united.  \\n  \"Let them come,\" he said. \"I, for one, will shower them with rose petals.\"  \\n T '),\n",

In every battered neighborhood, Mariam found \\npeople materializing from the rubble and moving into the streets. She saw an old woman \\nwasting handfuls of rice, tossing it at passersby, a drooping, toothless smile  on her face. \\nTwo men were hugging by the remains of a gutted building, in the sky above them the \\nwhistle, hiss, and pop of a few firecrackers set off by boys perched on rooftops. The \\nnational anthem played on cassette decks, competing with the honking of cars. \\n  \"Look, Mayam!\" Aziza pointed to a group of boys running down Jadeh Maywand. They \\nwere pounding their fists into the air and dragging rusty cans tied to strings. They were \\nyelling that Massoud and Rabbani had withdrawn from Kabul.  \\n  Everywhere, ther e were shouts:  Ailah u akbar!  \\n  Mariam saw a bedsheet hanging from a window on Jadeh Maywand. On it, someone had \\npainted three words in big, black letters: zendabaad taliban! Long live the Taliban!  \\n  As they walked the streets, Mariam spotted more signs pa inted on windows, nailed to \\ndoors, billowing from car antennas that proclaimed the same.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mariam saw  her first of the Taliban later that day, at Pashtunistan Square, with Rasheed, \\nLaila, and Aziza. A melee of people had gathered there. Mariam saw people craning their \\nnecks, people crowded around the blue fountain in the center of the square, people perched \\non its dry bed. They were trying to get a view of the end of the square, near the old Khyber \\nRestaurant.  \\n  Rasheed used his size to push and sho ve past the onlookers, and led them to where \\nsomeone was speaking through a loudspeaker.  \\n  When Aziza saw, she let out a shriek and buried her face in Mariam\\'s burqa.  \\n  The loudspeaker voice belonged to a slender, bearded young man who wore a black \\nturban.  He was standing on some sort of makeshift scaffolding. In his free hand, he held a \\nrocket launcher. Beside him, two bloodied men hung from ropes tied to traffic light posts. \\nTheir clothes had been shredded. Their bloated faces had turned purple blue.  \\n  \"I know him,\" Mariam said, \"the one on the left.\"  \\n  A young woman in front of Mariam turned around and said it was Najibullah. The other \\nman was his brother. Mariam remembered Najibullah\\'s plump, mustachioed face, beaming \\nfrom billboards and storefront windo ws during the Soviet years.  \\n  She would later hear that the Taliban had dragged Najibullah from his sanctuary at the UN \\nheadquarters near Darulaman Palace. That they had tortured him for hours, then tied his \\nlegs to a truck and dragged his lifeless body th rough the streets.  \\n  \"He killed many, many Muslims!\" the young Talib was shouting through the loudspeaker. \\nHe spoke Farsi with a Pashto accent, then would switch to Pashto. He punctuated his words \\nby pointing to the corpses with his weapon. \"His crimes are  known to everybody. He was a \\ncommunist and a kqfir  This is what we do with infidels who commit crimes against Islam!\"  \\n  Rasheed was smirking.  \\n  In Mariam\\'s arms, Aziza began to cry.  \\n '),\n",

It \\nwould have crippled him.  \\n  Men wielding pickaxes swarmed the dilapidated Kabul Museum and smashed pre Islamic \\nstatues to rubble that is, those that hadn\\'t already been looted by the Mujahi deen. The \\nuniversity was shut down and its students sent home. Paintings were ripped from walls, \\nshredded with blades. Television screens were kicked in. Books, except the Koran, were \\nburned in heaps, the stores that sold them closed down. The poems of Kha lili, Pajwak, \\nAnsari, Haji Dehqan, Ashraqi, Beytaab, Hafez, Jami, Nizami, Rumi, Khayyam, Beydel, and \\nmore went up in smoke.  \\n  Laila heard of men being dragged from the streets, accused of skipping  namaz,  and \\nshoved into mosques. She learned that Marco Polo  Restaurant, near Chicken Street, had \\nbeen turned into an interrogation center. Sometimes screaming was heard from behind its \\nblack painted windows. Everywhere, the Beard Patrol roamed the streets in Toyota trucks \\non the lookout for clean shaven faces to b loody.  \\n  They shut down the cinemas too. Cinema Park. Ariana. Aryub. Projection rooms were \\nransacked and reels of films set to fire. Laila remembered all the times she and Tariq had \\nsat in those theaters and watched Hindi films, all those melodramatic tale s of lovers \\nseparated by some tragic turn of fate, one adrift in some faraway land, the other forced into \\nmarriage, the weeping, the singing in fields of marigolds, the longing for reunions. She \\nremembered how Tariq would laugh at her for crying at those f ilms.  \\n \\n  \"I wonder what they\\'ve done to my father\\'s cinema,\" Mariam said to her one day. \"If it\\'s \\nstill there, that is. Or if he still owns it.\"  \\n  Kharabat, Kabul\\'s ancient music ghetto, was silenced. Musicians were beaten and \\nimprisoned, their  rubab s tambouras, and harmoniums trampled upon. The Taliban went to \\nthe grave of Tariq\\'s favorite singer, Ahmad Zahir, and fired bullets into it.  \\n  \"He\\'s been dead for almost twenty years,\" Laila said to Mariam. \"Isn\\'t dying once \\nenough?\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Rasheed wasn’t  bothered much by the Taliban. All he had to do was grow a beard, which \\nhe did, and visit the mosque, which he also did. Rasheed regarded the Taliban with a \\nforgiving, affectionate kind of bemusement, as one might regard an erratic cousin prone to \\nunpredictabl e acts of hilarity and scandal.  \\n  Every Wednesday night, Rasheed listened to the Voice of  Shari\\'a  when the Taliban would \\nannounce the names of those scheduled for punishment. Then, on Fridays, he went to Ghazi \\nStadium, bought a Pepsi, and watched the spect acle. In bed, he made Laila listen as he \\ndescribed with a queer sort of exhilaration the hands he\\'d seen severed, the lashings, the \\nhangings, the beheadings.  \\n  \"I saw a man today slit the throat of his brother\\'s murderer,\" he said one night, blowing \\nhalos of smoke.

When the doctor was done, \\nshe gave the glove to a nurse, who rinsed i t and  \\n  pinned it back on the string.  \\n  \"Your daughter needs a caesarian. Do you know what that is? We have to open her womb \\nand take the baby out, because it is in the breech position.\"  \\n  \"I don\\'t understand,\" Mariam said.  \\n  The doctor said the baby was p ositioned so it wouldn\\'t come out on its own. \"And too \\nmuch time has passed as is. We need to go to the operating room now.\"  \\n  Laila gave a grimacing nod, and her head drooped to one side.  \\n \\n  \"There  is something I have to tell you,\" the doctor said. She mo ved closer to Mariam, \\nleaned in, and spoke in a lower, more confidential tone. There was a hint of embarrassment \\nin her voice now.  \\n  \"What is she saying?\" Laila groaned. \"Is something wrong with the baby?\"  \\n  \"But how will she stand it?\" Mariam said.  \\n  The doctor must have heard accusation in this question, judging by the defensive shift in \\nher tone.  \\n  \"You think I want it this way?\" she said. \"What do you want me to do? They won\\'t give \\nme what I need. I have no X ray either, no suction, no oxygen, not even simple antibiotics. \\nWhen NGOs offer money, the Taliban turn them away. Or they funnel the money to the \\nplaces that cater to men.\"  \\n  \"But, Doctor sahib, isn\\'t there something you can give her?\" Mariam asked.  '),\n",

So you\\'d have to  fight through traffic from \\none place to the next, maybe all the way across town, with little likelihood that you\\'d ever \\nfind it. It\\'s almost eight thirty now, so you\\'ll probably get arrested for breaking curfew. \\nEven if you find the medicine, chances are you can\\'t afford it. Or you\\'ll find yourself in a \\nbidding war with someone just as desperate. There is no time. This baby needs to come out \\nnow.\"  \\n  \"Tell me what\\'s going on!\" Laila said She had propped herself up on her elbows.  \\n  The doctor took a breath, then told Laila that the hospital had no anesthetic.  \\n  \"But if we delay, you will lose your baby.\"  \\n  \"Then cut me open,\" Laila said. She dropped back on the bed and drew up her knees. \"Cut \\nme open and give me my baby.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Inside the old, dingy opera ting room, Laila lay on a gurney bed as the doctor scrubbed her \\nhands in a basin. Laila was shivering. She drew in air through her teeth every time the nurse \\nwiped her belly with a cloth soaked in a yellow brown liquid. Another nurse stood at the \\ndoor. She  kept cracking it open to take a peek outside.  \\n  The doctor was out of her burqa now, and Mariam saw that she had a crest of silvery hair, \\nheavy lidded eyes, and little pouches of fatigue at the corners of her mouth.  \\n  \"They want us to operate in burqa,\" t he doctor explained, motioning with her head to the \\nnurse at the door. \"She keeps watch. She sees them coming; I cover.\"  \\n  She said this in a pragmatic, almost indifferent, tone, and Mariam understood that this was \\na woman far past outrage. Here was a woma n, she thought, who had understood that she \\nwas lucky to even be working, that there was always something, something else, that they \\ncould take away.  \\n  There were two vertical, metallic rods on either side of Laila\\'s shoulders. With clothespins, \\nthe nurse who\\'d cleansed Laila\\'s belly pinned a sheet to them. It formed a curtain between \\nLaila and the doctor.  \\n  Mariam positioned herself behind the crown of Laila\\'s head and lowered her face so their \\ncheeks touched. She could feel Laila\\'s teeth rattling. Their h ands locked together.  \\n  Through the curtain, Mariam saw the doctor\\'s shadow move to Laila\\'s left, the nurse to the \\nright. Laila\\'s lips had stretched all the way back. Spit bubbles formed and popped on the \\nsurface of her clenched teeth. She made quick, litt le hissing sounds.  \\n  The doctor said, \"Take heart, little sister.\"  \\n  She bent over Laila.  \\n  Laila\\'s eyes snapped open. Then her mouth opened. She held like this, held, held, \\nshivering, the cords in her neck stretched, sweat dripping from her face, her fing ers \\ncrushing Mariam\\'s.  \\n \\n  Mariam would always admire Laila for how much time passed before she screamed.  \\n '),\n",

One morning, she pointed to a patch of soil behind \\nthe toolshed. \"We can do it here,\" s he said. \"This is a good spot\"  \\n  They took turns striking the ground with a spade, then shoveling the loose dirt aside. They \\nhadn\\'t planned on a big hole, or a deep one, so the work of digging shouldn\\'t have been as \\ndemanding as it turned out. It was the d rought, started in 1998, in its second year now, that \\nwas wreaking havoc everywhere. It had hardly snowed that past winter and didn\\'t rain at all \\nthat spring. All over the country, farmers were leaving behind their parched lands, selling \\noff their goods, r oaming from village to village looking for water. They moved to Pakistan \\nor Iran. They settled in Kabul. But water tables were low in the city too, and the shallow \\nwells had dried up. The lines at the deep wells were so long, Laila and Mariam would \\nspend h ours waiting their turn. The Kabul River, without its yearly spring floods, had \\nturned bone dry. It was a public toilet now, nothing in it but human waste and rubble.  \\n  So they kept swinging the spade and striking, but the sun blistered ground had hardened  \\nlike a rock, the dirt unyielding, compressed, almost petrified.  \\n  Mariam was forty now. Her hair, rolled up above her face, had a few stripes of gray in it. \\nPouches sagged beneath her eyes, brown and crescent shaped. She\\'d lost two front teeth. \\nOne fell o ut, the other Rasheed knocked out when she\\'d accidentally dropped Zalmai. Her \\nskin had coarsened, tanned from all the time they were spending in the yard  sitting  beneath \\nthe brazen sun. They would sit and watch Zalmai chase Aziza.  \\n  When it was done, when the hole was dug, they stood over it and looked down.  \\n  \"It should do,\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Zalmai was two  now.  He was a plump little boy with curly hair. He had small brownish  \\neyes, and a rosy tint to  his cheeks, like Rasheed, no matter the weather. He  had his father\\'s  \\nhairline  too, thick and half moon shaped,  set low on his brow.  \\n  When Laila was alone with him, Zalmai was sweet, good humored, and playful. He liked \\nto climb Laila\\'s  shoulders, play  hide and seek in the yard with her and Aziza. Sometimes , in \\nhis calmer moments, he liked to  sit on  Laila\\'s lap and have her sing to  him. His favorite \\nsong  was \"Mullah Mohammad Jan.\" He swung his meaty little feet as she sang into his \\ncurly hair and joined in when she got to the chorus, singing what words he co uld make with \\nhis raspy voice:  \\n \\n  Come and lei\\'s go to Mazar, Mullah Mohammadjan, To see the fields of tulips, o beloved \\ncompanion.  \\n \\n  Laila loved the moist kisses Zalmai planted on her cheeks, loved his dimpled elbows and \\nstout little toes.

Her stomach turned when she thought of that afternoon, lying on the floor \\nwith the spoke of a bicycle wheel between her legs. How close she\\'d come. It was \\nunthinkable to her now that she could have even entertained the idea. Her son was a \\nblessing, and Laila was relieved to discover that her fears had proved baseless, that she \\nloved Zalmai with t he marrow of her bones, just as she did Aziza.  \\n  But Zalmai worshipped his father, and, because he did, he was transformed when his \\nfather was around to dote on him. Zalmai was quick then with a defiant cackle or an \\nimpudent grin. In his father\\'s presence,  he was easily offended. He held grudges. He \\npersisted in mischief in spite of Laila\\'s scolding, which he never did when Rasheed was \\naway.  \\n  Rasheed approved of all of it. \"A sign of intelligence,\" he said. He said the same of \\nZalmai\\'s recklessness when he  swallowed, then pooped, marbles; when he lit matches; \\nwhen he chewed on Rasheed\\'s cigarettes.  \\n  When Zalmai was born, Rasheed had moved him into the bed he shared with Laila. He \\nhad bought him a new crib and had lions and crouching leopards painted on the  side panels. \\nHe\\'d paid for new clothes, new rattles, new bottles, new diapers, even though they could \\nnot afford them and Aziza\\'s old ones were still serviceable. One day, he came home with a \\nbattery run mobile, which he hung over Zalmai\\'s crib. Little ye llow and black bumblebees \\ndangled from a sunflower, and they crinkled and squeaked when squeezed. A tune played \\nwhen it was turned on.  \\n  \"I thought you said business was slow,\" Laila said.  \\n  \"I have friends I can borrow  from,\" he  saiddismissively.  \\n  \"How  will you pay them back?\"  \\n  \"Things  will turn  around. They always do. Look,  he likes it. See?\"  \\n  Most  days, Laila was deprived of  her son. Rasheed  took him to the shop, let him crawl \\naround under his crowded workbench, play with old rubber soles and spare sc raps of \\nleather. Rasheed drove in his iron nails and turned the sandpaper wheel, and kept a \\nwatchful eye on him. If Zalmai toppled a rack of shoes, Rasheed scolded him gently, in a \\ncalm, half smiling way. If he did it again, Rasheed put down  his hammer, sa t him up on his \\ndesk, and talked to him softly.  \\n  His patience with Zalmai  was a  well that ran deep and never dried.  \\n  They came home together in the evening, Zalmai\\'s head bouncing on Rasheed\\'s shoulder, \\nboth of them smelling of glue and leather. They gri nned the way people who share a secret \\ndo, slyly, like they\\'d  satin that dim shoe shop  all day not making shoes at all but  devising  \\nsecret plots. Zalmai liked to sit beside  his father at dinner,  where they played private games, \\nas Mariam, Laila, and Aziza  set plates on  the sojrah.  They took turns poking each other  on \\nthe chest, giggling, pelting each other with bread crumbs, whispering things the others \\ncouldn\\'t hear. If Laila spoke to  them,  Rasheed looked up with displeasure at the unwelcome \\nintrusion. If she asked to hold Zalmai or, worse,  if Zalmai reached for her Rasheed \\nglowered at her.  \\n  Laila walked away feeling stung.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Then one night, a few weeks after Zalmai turned two, Rasheed came home with a \\ntelevision and a VCR.

Wh en she saw the TV, she ran to it. \"Careful, Aziza jo,\" said  \\nMariam. \"Don\\'t touch.\"  \\n  Aziza\\'s hair had become as light as Laila\\'s. Laila could see her own dimples on her cheeks. \\nAziza had turned into a calm, pensive little girl, with a demeanor that to Lail a seemed \\nbeyond her six years. Laila marveled at her daughter\\'s manner of speech, her cadence and \\nrhythm, her thoughtful pauses and intonations, so adult, so at odds with the immature body \\nthat housed the voice. It was Aziza who with lightheaded authority had taken it upon \\nherself to wake Zalmai every day, to dress him, feed him his breakfast, comb his hair. She \\nwas the one who put him down to nap, who played even tempered peacemaker to her \\nvolatile sibling. Around him, Aziza had taken to giving an exaspera ted, queerly adult \\nheadshake.  \\n \\n  Aziza pushed the TV\\'s power button. Rasheed scowled, snatched her wrist and set it on \\nthe table, not gently at all.  \\n  \"This is Zalmai\\'s TV,\" he said.  \\n  Aziza went over to Mariam and climbed in her lap. The two of them were inseparable now. \\nOf late, with Laila\\'s blessing, Mariam had started teaching Aziza verses from the Koran. \\nAziza could already recite by heart the surah of  ikhlas,  the surah of  fatiha,  and already \\nknew how to perform the four  ruqats  of morning prayer.  \\n  It\\'s oil I have to give her,  Mariam had said to Laila,  this knowledge, these prayers. They\\'re \\nthe only true possession I\\'ve ever had.  \\n  Zalmai came into the room now. As Rasheed watched with anticipation, the way people \\nwait the simple tricks of street magici ans, Zalmai pulled on the TV\\'s wire, pushed the \\nbuttons, pressed his palms to the blank screen. When he lifted them, the condensed little \\npalms faded from the glass. Rasheed smiled with pride, watched as Zalmai kept pressing \\nhis palms and lifting them, ove r and over.  \\n  The Taliban had banned television. Videotapes had been gouged publicly, the tapes ripped \\nout and strung on fence posts. Satellite dishes had been hung from lampposts. But Rasheed \\nsaid just because things were banned didn\\'t mean you couldn\\'t f ind them.  \\n  \"I\\'ll start looking for some cartoon videos tomorrow,\" he said. \"It won\\'t be hard. You can \\nbuy anything in underground bazaars.\"  \\n \\n  \"Then maybe you\\'ll buy us a new well,\" Laila said, and this won her a scornful gaze from \\nhim. \\n  It was later, af ter another dinner of plain white rice had been consumed and tea forgone \\nagain on account of the drought, after Rasheed had smoked a cigarette, that he told Laila \\nabout his decision.  \\n  \"No,\" Laila said.  \\n  He said he wasn\\'t asking.  \\n  \"I don\\'t care if you ar e or not.\"  \\n  \"You would if you knew the full story.\"  \\n  He said he had borrowed from more friends than he let on, that the money from the shop \\nalone was no longer enough to sustain the five of them. \"I didn\\'t tell you earlier to spare \\nyou the worrying.\"  '),\n",

They were in the living room. Mariam and the children were in the \\nkitchen. Laila could hear the clatter of dishes, Zalmai\\'s high pitched laugh, Aziza saying \\nsomethin g to Mariam in her steady, reasonable voice.  \\n  \"There will be others like her, younger even,\" Rasheed said. \"Everyone in Kabul is doing \\nthe same.\"  \\n \\n  Laila told him she didn\\'t care what other people did with their children.  \\n  \"I\\'ll keep a close eye on her, \" Rasheed said, less patiently now. \"It\\'s a safe corner. There\\'s \\na mosque across the street.\"  \\n  \"I won\\'t let you turn my daughter into a street beggar!\" Laila snapped.  \\n  The slap made a loud smacking sound, the palm of his thick fingered hand connecting \\nsquarely with the meat of Laila\\'s cheek. It made her head whip around. It silenced the \\nnoises from the kitchen. For a moment, the house was perfectly quiet. Then a flurry of \\nhurried footsteps in the hallway before Mariam and the children were in the living r oom, \\ntheir eyes shifting from her to Rasheed and back.  \\n  Then Laila punched him.  \\n  It was the first time she\\'d struck anybody, discounting the playful punches she and Tariq \\nused to trade. But those had been open fisted, more pats than punches, self conscio usly \\nfriendly, comfortable expressions of anxieties that were both perplexing and thrilling. They \\nwould aim for the muscle that Tariq, in a professorial voice, called the  deltoid  \\n  Laila watched the arch of her closed fist, slicing through the air, felt th e crinkle of \\nRasheed\\'s stubbly, coarse skin under her knuckles. It made a sound like dropping a rice bag \\nto the floor. She hit him hard. The impact actually made him stagger two steps backward.  \\n \\n  From the other side of the room, a gasp, a yelp, and a scre am. Laila didn\\'t know who had \\nmade which noise. At the moment, she was too astounded to notice or care, waiting for her \\nmind to catch up with what her hand had done. When it did, she believed she might have \\nsmiled. She might have  grinned  when, to her aston ishment, Rasheed calmly walked out of \\nthe room.  \\n  Suddenly, it seemed to Laila that the collective hardships of their lives hers, Aziza\\'s, \\nMariam\\'s simply dropped away, vaporized like Zalmai\\'s palms from the TV screen. It \\nseemed worthwhile, if absurdly so,  to have endured all they\\'d endured for this one \\ncrowning moment, for this act of defiance that would end the suffering of all indignities.  \\n  Laila did not notice that Rasheed was back in the room. Until his hand was around her \\nthroat. Until she was lifted  off her feet and slammed against the wall.  \\n  Up close, his sneering face seemed impossibly large. Laila noticed how much puffier it \\nwas getting with age, how many more broken vessels charted tiny paths on his nose. \\nRasheed didn\\'t say anything. And, really , what could be said, what needed saying, when \\nyou\\'d shoved the barrel of your gun into your wife\\'s mouth?  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  It was the raids, the reason they were in the yard digging.

Say my name, Khala Mariam. Say it. Jack!\" \"Your father will be angry if you wake \\nhim.\"  \\n  \"Jack!

After curfew, everyone locked their doors, \\nturned out the lights, turned down the volume, and reaped tears for Jack and Rose and the \\npassengers of the doomed ship. If the re was electrical power, Mariam, Laila, and the \\nchildren watched it too. A dozen times or more, they unearthed the TV from behind the \\ntoolshed, late at night, with the lights out and quilts pinned over the windows.  \\n  At the Kabul River, vendors moved into the parched riverbed. Soon, from the river\\'s sun \\nbaked  hollows, it was possible to buy  Titanic  carpets, and  Titanic  cloth, from bolts arranged \\nin wheelbarrows.

The fire took the adjacent fabric store as well, a \\nsecondhand clothing store, a small furniture shop, a bakery.  \\n  They told Rasheed later that if the winds had blown east instead of west,  his shop, which \\nwas at the corner of the block, might have been spared.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  They sold everything.  \\n \\n  First to go were Mariam\\'s things, then Laila\\'s.

Rasheed\\'s \\nwatch too was sold, his old transistor radio, his pair of neckties, his shoes, and his wedding \\nring. The couch, the table, the rug, and the chairs went too. Zalmai threw a wicked tantrum \\nwhen Rasheed sold the TV.  \\n  After the  fire, Rasheed was home almost every day. He slapped Aziza. He kicked Mariam. \\nHe threw things. He found fault with Laila, the way she smelled, the way she dressed, the \\nway she combed her hair, her yellowing teeth.  \\n  \"What\\'s happened to you?\" he said. \"I ma rried  apart,  and now I\\'m saddled with a hag. \\nYou\\'re turning into Mariam.\"  \\n  He got fired from the kebab house near Haji Yaghoub Square because he and a customer \\ngot into a scuffle. The customer complained that Rasheed had rudely tossed the bread on \\nhis tab le. Harsh words had passed. Rasheed had called the customer a monkey faced Uzbek. \\nA gun had been brandished. A skewer pointed in return. In Rasheed\\'s version, he held the \\nskewer.

Then he stormed out \\nof the house.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  When the money ran out, hunger began to cast a pall over their lives. It was stunning to \\nMariam how quick ly alleviating hunger became the crux of their existence.  \\n \\n  Rice, boiled plain and white, with no meat or sauce, was a rare treat now. They skipped \\nmeals with increasing and alarming regularity. Sometimes Rasheed brought home sardines \\nin a can and brittle , dried bread that tasted like sawdust. Sometimes a stolen bag of apples, \\nat the risk of getting his hand sawed off. In grocery stores, he carefully pocketed canned \\nravioli, which they split five ways, Zalmai getting the lion\\'s share. They ate raw turnips \\nsprinkled with salt. Limp leaves of lettuce and blackened bananas for dinner.  \\n  Death from starvation suddenly became a distinct possibility. Some chose not to wait for it. \\nMariam heard of a neighborhood widow who had ground some dried bread, laced it with  \\nrat poison, and fed it to all seven of her children. She had saved the biggest portion for \\nherself.  \\n \\n  Aziza\\'s ribs began to push through the skin, and the fat from her cheeks vanished. Her \\ncalves thinned, and her complexion turned the color of weak tea. When Mariam picked her \\nup, she could feel her hip bone poking through the taut skin. Zalmai lay around the house, \\neyes dulled and half closed, or in his father\\'s lap limp as a rag. He cried himself to sleep, \\nwhen he could muster the energy, but his sleep w as fitful and sporadic. White dots leaped \\nbefore Mariam\\'s eyes whenever she got up. Her head spun, and her ears rang all the time. \\nShe remembered something Mullah Faizullah used to say about hunger when Ramadan \\nstarted:  Even the snakebiiien man finds sleep , but not the hungry.  \\n \\n  \"My children are going to die,\" Laila said. \"Right before my eyes.\"  \\n \\n  \"They are not,\" Mariam said. \"I won\\'t let them. It\\'s going to be all right, Laila jo. I know \\nwhat to do.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  One blistering hot day, Mariam put on her bu rqa, and she and Rasheed walked to the \\nIntercontinental Hotel. Bus fare was an un affordable luxury now, and Mariam was \\nexhausted by the time they reached the top of the steep hill. Climbing the slope, she was \\nstruck by bouts of dizziness, and twice she ha d to stop, wait for it to pass.  \\n  At the hotel entrance, Rasheed greeted and hugged one of the doormen, who was dressed \\nin a burgundy suit and visor cap. There was some friendly looking talk between them. \\nRasheed spoke with his hand on the doorman\\'s elbow.  He motioned toward Mariam at one \\npoint, and they both looked her way briefly. Mariam thought there was something vaguely \\nfamiliar about the doorman.  \\n \\n  When the doorman went inside, Mariam and Rasheed waited. From this vantage point, '),\n",

To the south, she could see the bread factory, Silo, long \\nabandoned, its pale yellow fa9ade pocked with yawning holes from all the shelling it had \\nendured. Far ther south, she could make out the hollow ruins of Darulaman Palace, where, \\nmany years back, Rasheed had taken her for a picnic. The memory of that day was a relic \\nfrom a past that no longer seemed like her own.  \\n \\n  Mariam concentrated on these things, thes e landmarks. She feared she might lose her \\nnerve if she let her mind wander.  \\n \\n  Every few minutes, jeeps and taxis drove up to the hotel entrance. Doormen rushed to \\ngreet the passengers, who were all men, armed, bearded, wearing turbans, all of them \\nsteppi ng out with the same self assured, casual air of menace. Mariam heard bits of their \\nchatter as they vanished through the hotel\\'s doors. She heard Pashto and Farsi, but Urdu and \\nArabic too.  \\n \\n  \"Meet our real masters,\" Rasheed said in a low pitched voice. \"Pa kistani and Arab \\nIslamists. The Taliban are puppets.  These  are the big players and Afghanistan is their \\nplayground.\"  \\n \\n  Rasheed said he\\'d heard rumors that the Taliban were allowing these people to set up \\nsecret camps all over the country, where young men were being trained to become suicide \\nbombers and jihadi fighters.  \\n \\n  \"What\\'s taking him so long?\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n  Rasheed spat, and kicked dirt on the spit.  \\n  An hour later, they were inside, Mariam and Rasheed, following the doorman. Their heels \\nclicked o n the tiled floor as they were led across the pleasantly cool lobby. Mariam saw two \\nmen sitting on leather chairs, rifles and a coffee table between them, sipping black tea and \\neating from a plate of syrup coated  jelabi,  rings sprinkled with powdered sugar . She \\nthought of Aziza, who loved  jelabi,  and tore her gaze away.  \\n \\n  The doorman led them outside to a balcony. From his pocket, he produced a small black \\ncordless phone and a scrap of paper with a number scribbled on it. He told Rasheed it was \\nhis supervi sor\\'s satellite phone.  \\n \\n  \"I got you five minutes,\" he said. \"No more.\"  \\n  \"Tashakor,\"  Rasheed said. \"I won\\'t forget this.\"  \\n \\n  The doorman nodded and walked away. Rasheed dialed. He gave Mariam the phone.  \\n \\n  As Mariam listened to the scratchy ringing, her m ind wandered. It wandered to the last \\ntime she\\'d seen Jalil, thirteen years earlier, back in the spring of 1987. He\\'d stood on the \\nstreet outside her house, leaning on a cane, beside the blue Benz with the Herat license \\nplates and the white stripe bisectin g the roof, the hood, and trunk.

Mariam had parted the curtain once, just a bit, and caught a glimpse of \\nhim. Only a glimpse , but long enough to see that his hair had turned fluffy white, and that \\nhe\\'d started to stoop. He wore glasses, a red tie, as always, and the usual white handkerchief \\ntriangle in his breast pocket. Most striking, he was thinner, much thinner, than she \\nremembered, the coat of his dark brown suit drooping over his shoulders, the trousers \\npooling at his ankles.  \\n \\n  Jalil had seen her too, if only for a moment. Their eyes had met briefly through a part in \\nthe curtains, as they had met many years earlier through  a part in another pair of curtains. \\nBut then Mariam had quickly closed the curtains. She had sat on the bed, waited for him to \\nleave.  \\n \\n  She thought now of the letter Jalil had finally left at her door. She had kept it for days, \\nbeneath her pillow, pickin g it up now and then, turning it over in her hands. In the end, she \\nhad shredded it unopened.  \\n \\n  And now here she was, after all these years, calling him.  \\n  Mariam regretted her foolish, youthful pride now. She wished now that she had let him in. \\nWhat woul d have been the harm to let him in, sit with him, let him say what he\\'d come to \\nsay? He was her father. He\\'d not been a good father, it was true, but how ordinary his faults \\nseemed now, how forgivable, when compared to Rasheed\\'s malice, or to the brutality  and \\nviolence that she had seen men inflict on one another.  \\n \\n  She wished she hadn\\'t destroyed his letter.  \\n  A man\\'s deep voice spoke in her ear and informed her that she\\'d reached the mayor\\'s \\noffice in Herat.  \\n \\n  Mariam cleared her throat. \"Salaam,  brother,  I am looking for someone who lives in Herat. \\nOr he did, many years ago. His name is Jalil Khan. He lived in Shar -e-Nau and owned the \\ncinema. Do you have any information as to his whereabouts?\"  \\n  The irritation was audible in the man\\'s voice. \"This is why  you call the mayor\\'s office?\"  \\n  Mariam said she didn\\'t know who else to call. \"Forgive me, brother. I know you have \\nimportant things to tend to, but it is life and death, a question of life and death I am calling \\nabout.\"  \\n \\n  \"I don\\'t know him. The cinema\\'s been closed for many years.\"  \\n  \"Maybe there\\'s someone there who might know him, someone \"  \\n  \"There is no one.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam closed her eyes. \"Please, brother. There are children involved. Small children.\"  \\n \\n  A long sigh.  \\n \\n  \"Maybe someone there \"  \\n '),\n",

I think he\\'s lived here all of his life.\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes, ask him, please.\"  \\n \\n  \"Call back tomorrow.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam said she couldn\\'t. \"I have this phone for five minutes only. I don\\'t \"  \\n  There was a click at the other end, and Mariam thought he  had hung up. But she could \\nhear footsteps, and voices, a distant car horn, and some mechanical humming punctuated \\nby clicks, maybe an electric fan. She switched the phone to her other ear, closed her eyes.  \\n \\n  She pictured Jalil smiling, reaching into his pocket.  \\n \\n  Ah. Of course. Well Here then. Without Juriher ado…  \\n \\n  A leaf shaped pendant, tiny coins etched with moons and stars hanging from it.  \\n \\n  Try it on, Mariam jo.  \\n \\n  What do you think?  \\n \\n  I think  you look like a queen.  \\n \\n  A few minutes passed. Then footsteps, a creaking sound, and a click. \"He does know \\nhim.\"  \\n \\n  \"He does?\"  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s what he says.\"  \\n \\n  \"Where is he?\" Mariam said. \"Does this man know where Jalil Khan is?\"  \\n \\n  There was a pause. \"He says he died years ago, back in 1987.\"  \\n  Mariam\\'s stomach  fell. She\\'d considered the possibility, of course. Jalil would have been \\nin his mid to late seventies by now, but…  \\n \\n1987.  \\n \\n  He was dying then. He had driven all the way from Herat to say good bye.  \\n  She moved to the edge of the balcony. From up here, she  could see the hotel\\'s once \\nfamous swimming pool, empty and grubby now, scarred by bullet holes and decaying tiles. \\nAnd there was the battered tennis court, the ragged net lying limply in the middle of it like \\ndead skin shed by a snake.  \\n \\n  \"I have to go no w,\" the voice at the other end said  \\n '),\n",

She \\nsaw Jalil waving to her, skipping from stone to stone as he crossed the stream, his pockets \\nswollen with gifts.

Mariam shook her head.  \\n  \"Useless,\" he said, snatching the phone from h er. \"Like daughter, like father.\"  \\n  On their way out of the lobby, Rasheed walked briskly to the coffee table, which was now \\nabandoned, and pocketed the last ring  of jelabi.

The sky was a translucent gray, and gusts \\nof a clammy, cold wind kept rattling the screen door.  \\n  This was a few days after Laila heard that Ahmad Shah Massoud had gone to France and \\nspoken to the European Parliament. Massoud was now in his native North, and leading the \\nNorthern Alliance, the sole opposition group still fighting the Taliban. In Europe, Massoud \\nhad warned the West about terrorist camps in Afghanistan, and pleaded with the U.S. to \\nhelp him fight the Taliban.  \\n \\n  \"If President Bush doesn\\'t help us,\" he had said, \"these terrorists will damage the U.S. and \\nEurope very soon.\"  \\n \\n  A month before that, Laila had learned that the Taliban had planted TNT in the crevices of \\nthe giant Budd  has in Bamiyan and blown them apart,  calling them objects of idolatry and \\nsin. There was an outcry around the world, from the U.S. to China. Governments, historians, \\nand archaeologists from all over the globe had written letters, pleaded with the Taliban not \\nto demolish the two greatest hist orical artifacts in Afghanistan. But the Taliban had gone \\nahead and detonated their explosives inside the two thousand year old Buddhas. They had \\nchanted  Allah u akbar  with each blast, cheered each time the statues lost an arm or a leg in \\na crumbling cloud  of dust. Laila remembered standing atop the bigger of the two Buddhas \\nwith Babi and Tariq, back in 1987, a breeze blowing in their sunlit faces, watching a hawk \\ngliding in circles over the sprawling valley below. But when she heard the news of the \\nstatues \\' demise, Laila was numb to it. It hardly seemed to matter. How could she care about \\nstatues when her own life was crumbling dust?  \\n  Until Rasheed told her it was time to go, Laila sat on the floor in a comer of the living \\nroom, not speaking and stone face d, her hair hanging around her face in straggly curls. No \\nmatter how much she breathed in and out, it seemed to Laila that she couldn\\'t fill her lungs \\nwith enough air.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  On the way to Karteh Seh, Zalmai bounced in Rasheed\\'s arms, and Aziza held Mar iam\\'s \\nhand as she walked quickly beside her. The wind blew the dirty scarf tied under Aziza\\'s \\nchin and rippled the hem of her dress. Aziza was more grim now, as though she\\'d begun to \\nsense, with each step, that she was being duped. Laila had not found the strength to tell \\nAziza the truth. She had told her that she was going to a school, a special school where the \\nchildren ate and slept and didn\\'t come home after class. Now Aziza kept pelting Laila with \\nthe same questions she had been asking for days. Did th e students sleep in different rooms \\nor all in one great big room? Would she make friends?

Aziza took it and muttered a thank you. Laila marveled at Az iza\\'s \\ngrace, Aziza\\'s vast capacity for forgiveness, and her eyes filled. Her heart squeezed, and \\nshe was faint with sorrow at the thought that this afternoon Aziza would not nap beside her, \\nthat she would not feel the flimsy weight of Aziza\\'s arm on her ch est, the curve of Aziza\\'s \\nhead pressing into her ribs, Aziza\\'s breath warming her neck, Aziza\\'s heels poking her \\nbelly.  \\n \\n  When Aziza was led away, Zalmai began wailing, crying, Ziza! Ziza! He squirmed and \\nkicked in his father\\'s arms, called for his sister , until his attention was diverted by an organ \\ngrinder\\'s monkey across the street.  \\n \\n  They walked the last two blocks alone, Mariam, Laila, and Aziza. As they approached the \\nbuilding, Laila could see its splintered fa9ade, the sagging roof, the planks of w ood nailed \\nacross frames with missing windows, the top of a swing set over a decaying wall.  \\n \\n  They stopped by the door, and Laila repeated to Aziza what she had told her earlier.  \\n \\n  \"And if they ask about your father, what do you say?\"  \\n  \"The Mujahideen k illed him,\" Aziza said, her mouth set with wariness.  \\n \\n  \"That\\'s good. Aziza, do you understand?\"  \\n \\n  \"Because this is a special school,\" Aziza said Now that they were here, and the building \\nwas a reality, she looked shaken. Her lower lip was quivering and h er eyes threatened to \\nwell up, and Laila saw how hard she was struggling to be brave. \"If we tell the truth,\" Aziza \\nsaid in a thin, breathless voice, \"they won\\'t take me. It\\'s a special school.

If it kills me, I\\'ll come and see you.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The orphanage director was a stooping, narrow chested man with a pleasantly lined face. \\nHe was balding, had a shaggy beard, eyes like peas. His name was Zaman. He wore a \\nskullcap. The left lens of his eyeglasses was chipped.  \\n  As he led them to his office, he asked Laila and Mariam their names, asked for Aziza\\'s \\nname too, her age. They passed through poorly lit hallways where barefoot ch ildren stepped \\naside and watched They had disheveled hair or shaved scalps. They wore sweaters with \\nfrayed sleeves, ragged jeans whose knees had worn down to strings, coats patched with \\nduct tape. Laila smelled soap and talcum, ammonia and urine, and risin g apprehension in \\nAziza, who had begun whimpering.  \\n  Laila had a glimpse of the yard: weedy lot, rickety swing set, old tires, a deflated \\nbasketball. The rooms they passed were bare, the windows covered with sheets of plastic. A \\nboy darted from one of the rooms and grabbed Laila\\'s elbow, and tried to climb up into her \\narms. An attendant, who was cleaning up what looked like a puddle of urine, put down his \\nmop and pried the boy off.  \\n \\n  Zaman seemed gently proprietary with the orphans. He patted the heads of some, as he \\npassed by, said a cordial word or two to them, tousled their hair, without condescension. \\nThe children welcomed his touch. They all looked at him, Laila thought, in hope of \\napproval.  \\n  He showed them into his office, a room with only three fold ing chairs, and a disorderly \\ndesk with piles of paper scattered atop it.  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re from Herat,\" Zaman said to Mariam. \"I can tell from your accent.\"  \\n \\n  He leaned back in his chair and laced his hands over his belly, and said he had a brother in \\nlaw who us ed to live there. Even in these ordinary gestures, Laila noted a laborious quality \\nto his movements. And though he was smiling faintly, Laila sensed something troubled and \\nwounded beneath, disappointment and defeat glossed over with a veneer of good humor.  \\n \\n  \"He was a glassmaker,\" Zaman said. \"He made these beautiful, jade green swans. You \\nheld them up to sunlight and they glittered inside, like the glass was filled with tiny jewels. \\nHave you been back?\"  \\n \\n  Mariam said she hadn\\'t.  \\n  \"I\\'m from Kandahar myse lf. Have you ever been to Kandahar, hamshira1?  No? It\\'s lovely. \\nWhat gardens! And the grapes! Oh, the grapes. They bewitch the palate.\"  \\n  A few children had gathered by the door and were peeking in. Zaman gently shooed them \\naway, in Pashto.  \\n \\n  \"Of course I love Herat too.

I\\'ve made you laugh, littl e hamshira.  That\\'s usually the \\nhard part. I was worried, there, for a while. I thought I\\'d have to cluck like a chicken or bray \\nlike a donkey. But, there you are. And so lovely you are.\"  \\n \\n  He called in an attendant to look after Aziza for a few moments. A ziza leaped onto \\nMariam\\'s lap and clung to her.  \\n \\n  \"We\\'re just going to talk, my love ,\" Laila said. \"I\\'ll be right here. All right? Right here.\"  \\n \\n  \"Why don\\'t we go outside for a minute, Aziza jo?\" Mariam said. \"Your mother needs to \\ntalk to Kaka Zaman here . Just for a minute. Now, come on.\"  \\n \\n  When they were alone, Zaman asked for Aziza\\'s date of birth, history of illnesses, \\nallergies. He asked about Aziza\\'s father, and Laila had the strange experience of telling a lie \\nthat was really the truth. Zaman liste ned, his expression revealing neither belief nor \\nskepticism. He ran the orphanage on the honor system, he said. If a  hamshira  said her \\nhusband was dead and she couldn\\'t care for her children, he didn\\'t question it.  \\n \\n  Laila began to cry.  \\n  Zaman put down h is pen.  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m ashamed,\" Laila croaked, her palm pressed to her mouth.  \\n \\n  \"Look at me,  hamshira  \" \\n \\n  \"What kind of mother abandons her own child?\"  \\n \\n  \"Look at me.\"  \\n \\n  Laila raised her gaze.  \\n  \"It isn\\'t your fault.

In her he ad, she \\nsaw Zaman\\'s thick, calloused hands close around Aziza\\'s arms; she saw them pull, gently at \\nfirst, then harder, then with force to pry Aziza loose from her. She saw Aziza kicking in \\nZaman\\'s arms as he hurriedly turned the corner, heard Aziza screami ng as though she were \\nabout to vanish from the face of the earth. And Laila saw herself running down the hallway, \\nhead down, a howl rising up her throat.  \\n  \"I smell her,\" she told Mariam at home. Her eyes swam unseeingly past Mariam\\'s shoulder, \\npast the ya rd, the walls, to the mountains, brown as smoker\\'s spit. \"I smell her sleep smell. \\nDo you? Do you smell it?\"  \\n \\n  \"Oh, Laila jo,\" said Mariam. \"Don\\'t. What good is this? What good?\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  At first, Rasheed humored Laila, and accompanied them her, Mariam,  and Zalmai to the \\norphanage, though he made sure, as they walked, that she had an eyeful of his grievous \\nlooks, an earful of his rants over what a hardship she was putting him through, how badly \\nhis legs and back and feet ached walking to and from the orp hanage. He made sure she \\nknew how awfully put out he was.  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m not a young man anymore,\" he said. \"Not that you care. You\\'d run me to the ground, \\nif you had your way. But you don\\'t, Laila. You don\\'t have your way.\"  \\n  They parted ways two blocks from the  orphanage, and he never spared them more than \\nfifteen minutes. \"A minute late,\" he said, \"and I start walking. I mean it.\"  \\n  Laila had to pester him, plead with him, in order to spin out the allotted minutes with \\nAziza a bit longer. For herself, and for M ariam, who was disconsolate over Aziza\\'s absence, \\nthough, as always, Mariam chose to cradle her own suffering privately and quietly. And for \\nZalmai too, who asked for his sister every day, and threw tantrums that sometimes \\ndissolved into inconsolable fits of crying.  \\n \\n  Sometimes, on the way to the orphanage, Rasheed stopped and complained that his leg \\nwas sore. Then he turned around and started walking home in long, steady strides, without \\nso much as a limp. Or he clucked his tongue and said, \"It\\'s my lungs , Laila. I\\'m short of '),\n",

Maybe tomorrow I\\'ll feel better, or the day after. We\\'ll see.\" He never bothered to \\nfeign a single raspy breath. Often, as he turned back and marched home, he lit a cigarette. \\nLaila would have to tail him home, helpless, tremb ling with resentment and impotent rage.  \\n \\n  Then one day he told Laila he wouldn\\'t take her anymore. \"I\\'m too tired from walking the \\nstreets all day,\" he said, \"looking for work.\"  \\n \\n  \"Then I\\'ll go by myself,\" Laila said. \"You can\\'t stop me, Rasheed. Do you hear me? You \\ncan hit me all you want, but I\\'ll keep going there.\"  \\n \\n  \"Do as you wish. But you won\\'t get past the Taliban. Don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m coming with you,\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n  Laila wouldn\\'t allow it. \"You have to stay home with Zalmai. I f we get stopped…I  don\\'t \\nwant him to see.\"  \\n \\n  And so Laila\\'s life suddenly revolved around finding ways to see Aziza. Half the time, she \\nnever made it to the orphanage. Crossing the street, she was spotted by the Taliban and \\nriddled with questions What is your name? Where are you going? Why are you alone? \\nWhere is your  mahram ?  before she was sent home. If she was lucky, she was given a \\ntongue lashing or a single kick to the rear, a shove in the back. Other times, she met with \\nassortments of wooden clubs, f resh tree branches, short whips, slaps, often fists.  \\n \\n  One day, a young Talib beat Laila with a radio antenna. When he was done, he gave a \\nfinal whack to the back of her neck and said, \"I see you again, I\\'ll beat you until your \\nmother\\'s milk leaks out of your bones.\"  \\n \\n  That time, Laila went home.

She made as if she were going  home, then took a different \\nroute down side streets. Sometimes she was caught, questioned, scolded two, three, even \\nfour times in a single day. Then the whips came down and the antennas sliced through the \\nair, and she trudged home, bloodied, without so mu ch as a glimpse of Aziza. Soon Laila \\ntook to wearing extra layers, even in the heat, two, three sweaters beneath the burqa, for \\npadding against the beatings.  \\n \\n  But for Laila, the reward, if she made it past the Taliban, was worth it. She could spend as \\nmuch time as she liked then hours,  even with Aziza. They sat in the courtyard, near the \\nswing set, among other children and visiting mothers, and talked about what Aziza had \\nlearned that week.  \\n  Aziza said Kaka Zaman made it a point to teach them something e very day, reading and \\nwriting most days, sometimes geography, a bit of history or science, something about \\nplants, animals.  \\n \\n  \"But we have to pull the curtains,\" Aziza said, \"so the Taliban don\\'t see us.\" Kaka Zaman '),\n",

Laila recognized the sharp face , the heavy \\neyebrows, if not the sunken mouth and gray hair. She remembered the shawls, the black \\nskirts, the curt voice, how she used to wear her jet black hair tied in a bun so that you could \\nsee the dark bristles on the back of her neck. Laila remembere d this woman once forbidding \\nthe female students from covering, saying women and men were equal, that there was no \\nreason women should cover if men didn\\'t.  \\n \\n  At one point, Khala Rangmaal looked up and caught her gaze, but Laila saw no lingering, \\nno light of recognition, in her old teacher\\'s eyes.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  \"They\\'re fractures along the earth\\'s crust,\" said Aziza. \\'They\\'re called faults.\"  \\n \\n  It was a warm afternoon, a Friday, in June of 2001. They were sitting in the orphanage\\'s \\nback lot, the four of them, L aila, Zalmai, Mariam, and Aziza. Rasheed had relented this \\ntime as he infrequently did and accompanied the four of them. He was waiting down the \\nstreet, by the bus stop.  \\n \\n  Barefoot kids scampered about around them. A flat soccer ball was kicked around, ch ased \\nafter listlessly.  \\n  \"And, on either side of the faults, there are these sheets of rock that make up the earth\\'s \\ncrust,\" Aziza was saying.  \\n \\n  Someone had pulled the hair back from Aziza\\'s face, braided it, and pinned it neatly on \\ntop of her head. Laila  begrudged whoever had gotten to sit behind her daughter, to flip \\nsections of her hair one over the other, had asked her to sit still.  \\n  Aziza was demonstrating by opening her hands, palms up, and rubbing them against each \\nother. Zalmai watched this with i ntense interest.  \\n \\n  \"Kectonic plates, they\\'re called?\"  \\n \\n  \"Tectonic, \" Laila said. It hurt to talk. Her jaw was still sore, her back and neck ached. Her \\nlip was swollen, and her tongue kept poking the empty pocket of the lower incisor Rasheed \\nhad knocked lo ose two days before. Before Mammy and Babi had died and her life turned \\nupside down, Laila never would have believed that a human body could withstand this \\nmuch beating, this viciously, this regularly, and keep functioning.  \\n \\n  \"Right. And when they slide p ast each other, they catch and slip see, Mammy? and it \\nreleases energy, which  \\n \\n  travels to the earth\\'s surface and makes it shake.\"  '),\n",

And Kaka Zaman says \\nthat, sometimes, the shifting of rocks is deep, deep below, and it\\'s powerful and scary down \\nthere, but all we feel on the surface is a slight tremor. Only a slight tremor.\"  \\n \\n  The visit before this one, it was o xygen atoms in the atmosphere scattering the blue light \\nfrom the sun.  If the earth had no atmosphere,  Aziza had said a little breathlessly,  the sky \\nwouldn’ t be blue at all but a pitch black sea and the sun a big bright star in the dark  \\n \\n  \"Is Aziza coming home with us this time?\" Zalmai said.  \\n  \"Soon, my love,\" Laila said. \"Soon.\"  \\n \\n  Laila watched him wander away, walking like his father, stooping forward, toes turned in. \\nHe walked to the swing set, pushed an empty seat, ended up sitting on the concrete, ri pping \\nweeds from a crack.  \\n \\n  Water evaporates from the leaves  Mammy, did you know?  the way it does from laundry \\nhanging from a line. And that drives the flow of water up the tree. From the ground and \\nthrough the roots, then all the way up the tree trunk, t hrough the branches and into the \\nleaves. It\\'s called transpiration.  \\n \\n  More than once, Laila had wondered what the Taliban would do about Kaka Zaman\\'s \\nclandestine lessons if they found out.  \\n \\n  During visits, Aziza didn\\'t allow for much silence. She filled all the spaces with effusive \\nspeech, delivered in a high, ringing voice. She was tangential with her topics, and her hands \\ngesticulated wildly, flying up with a nervousness that wasn\\'t like her at all. She had a new \\nlaugh, Aziza did. Not so much a laugh, r eally, as nervous punctuation, meant, Laila \\nsuspected, to reassure.  \\n \\n  And there were other changes. Laila would notice the dirt under Aziza\\'s fingernails, and \\nAziza would notice her noticing and bury her hands under her thighs. Whenever a kid cried \\nin the ir vicinity, snot oozing from his nose, or if a kid walked by bare assed, hair clumped \\nwith dirt, Aziza\\'s eyelids fluttered and she was quick to explain it away. She was like a \\nhostess embarrassed in front of her guests by the squalor of her home, the unti diness of her \\nchildren.  \\n \\n  Questions of how she was coping were met with vague but cheerful replies.  \\n \\n  Doing Jim, Khala I\\'m fine.  \\n \\n  Do kids pick on you?  \\n \\n  They don’t  Mammy. Everyone is nice.  \\n '),\n",

It was subtle but perceptible, and more \\npronounced with words that began wit h /. Laila asked Zaman about it. He frowned and said, \\n\"I thought she\\'d always done that.\"  \\n \\n  They left the orphanage with Aziza that Friday afternoon for a short outing and met \\nRasheed, who was waiting for them by the bus stop. When Zalmai spotted his fath er, he \\nuttered an excited squeak and impatiently wriggled from Laila\\'s arms. Aziza\\'s greeting to \\nRasheed was rigid but not hostile.  \\n \\n  Rasheed said they should hurry, he had only two hours before he had to report back to \\nwork. This was his first week as a doorman for the Intercontinental. From noon to eight, six \\ndays a week, Rasheed opened car doors, carried luggage, mopped up the occasional spill. \\nSometimes, at day\\'s end, the cook at the buffet style restaurant let Rasheed bring home a \\nfew leftovers as lon g as he was discreet about it cold meatballs sloshing in oil; fried \\nchicken wings, the crust gone hard and dry; stuffed pasta shells turned chewy; stiff, \\ngravelly rice. Rasheed had promised Laila that once he had some money saved up, Aziza \\ncould move back home.  \\n \\n  Rasheed was wearing his uniform, a burgundy red polyester suit, white shirt, clip on tie, \\nvisor cap pressing down on his white hair. In this uniform, Rasheed was transformed. He \\nlooked vulnerable, pitiably bewildered, almost harmless. Like someone  who had accepted \\nwithout a sigh of protest the indignities life had doled out to him. Someone both pathetic \\nand admirable in his docility.  \\n \\n  They rode the bus to Titanic City. They walked into the riverbed, flanked on either side by \\nmakeshift stalls clin ging to the dry banks. Near the bridge, as they were descending the \\nsteps, a barefoot man dangled dead from a crane, his ears cut off, his neck bent at the end of \\na rope. In the river, they melted into the horde of shoppers milling about, the money \\nchanger s and bored looking NGO workers, the cigarette vendors, the covered women who \\nthrust fake antibiotic prescriptions at people and begged for money to fill them. \\nWhip -toting,  naswar -chew ing Talibs patrolled Titanic City on the lookout for the indiscreet \\nlaugh, the unveiled face.  \\n  From a toy kiosk, between  a poos teen coat vendor and a fake flower stand, Zalmai picked \\nout a rubber basketball with yellow and blue swirls.  \\n \\n  \"Pick something,\" Rasheed said to Aziza.  \\n \\n  Aziza hedged, stiffened with embarrassment.  \\n \\n  \"Hurry.

I can\\'t afford both.\"  \\n \\n  On the way back, Aziza\\'s high spirited fa9ade waned the closer they got to the orphanage. \\nThe hands stopp ed flying  \\n \\n  up. Her face turned heavy.

She didn\\'t dare breathe, or blink \\neven, for fear that he was nothing but a mirage shimmering in the distance, a brittle illusion \\nthat would vanish  at the slightest provocation.

Mariam asked him not to, \\nbut he knew that she had no authority to exert over him and so he went on bouncing his ball, \\nhis eyes holding hers defiantly. For a while, they pushed his toy car, an ambulance with \\nbold red lettering on the sides, sending it back and forth between them across the room.  \\n \\n  Earlier, when they had met Tariq at the door, Zalmai had clutched the basketball close to \\nhis chest and stuck a thumb in his mouth something he didn\\'t do anymore except when he \\nwas ap prehensive. He had eyed Tariq with suspicion.  \\n  \"Who is that man?\" he said now. \"I don\\'t like him.\"  \\n \\n  Mariam was going to explain, say something about him and Laila growing up together, \\nbut Zalmai cut her off and said to turn the ambulance around, so the front grille faced him, \\nand, when she did, he said he wanted his basketball again.  \\n  \"Where is it?\" he said. \"Where is the ball Baba jan got me? Where is it? I want it! I want \\nit!\" his voice rising and  \\n  becoming more shrill with each word.  \\n \\n  \"It was just  here,\" Mariam said, and he cried, \"No, it\\'s lost, I know it. I just know it\\'s lost! \\nWhere is it? Where is it?\"  \\n \\n  \"Here,\" she said, fetching the ball from the closet where it had rolled to.

Where? \\nWhere where where?  \\n \\n  He screamed until Laila had to come upstairs to hold him, to rock him and run her fingers \\nthrough his tigh t, dark curls, to dry his moist cheeks and cluck her tongue in his ear.  \\n \\n  Mariam waited outside the room. From atop the staircase, all she could see of Tariq were \\nhis long legs, the real one and the artificial one, in khaki pants, stretched out on the \\nuncarpeted living room floor.

Flying int o sunsets too, I\\'m afraid.\"  \\n  \"Flamingos,\" Laila said. She looked at him sitting against the wall, his good leg bent at the \\nknee. She had an urge to touch him again, as she had earlier by the front gate when she\\'d \\nrun to him. It embarrassed her now to thin k of how she\\'d thrown her arms around his neck \\nand wept into his chest, how she\\'d said his name over and over in a slurring, thick voice. \\nHad she acted too eagerly, she wondered, too desperately? Maybe so. But she hadn\\'t been \\nable to help it.

After they\\'d tied the cousin\\'s feet and flogged his soles bloody, they had \\npresented him with a choice: Either destroy the paintings or make the flamingos decent. So \\nthe cousin had picked up his brush and painted trousers on every last bird  \\n \\n  \"And th ere you have it.

Such an adult word, such an adult gesture, and why \\nshould it be so startling? He  was an adult now, Tariq, a twenty five year old man with slow \\nmovements and a tiredness to his smi le. Tall, bearded, slimmer than in her dreams of him, \\nbut with strong looking hands, workman\\'s hands, with tortuous, full veins. His face was still \\nlean and handsome but not fair skinned any longer; his brow had a weathered look to it, \\nsunburned, like his neck, the brow of a traveler at the end of a long and wearying journey. \\nHis pakol  was pushed back on his head, and she could see that he\\'d started to lose his hair. \\nThe hazel of his eyes was duller than she remembered, paler, or perhaps it was merely the \\nlight in the room.  \\n T '),\n",

And his father, with his squinty gaze, his wry humor. Earlier, at the door, with a voice \\nfull of tears, tripping over her own words, she\\'d told Tariq what she thought had happened \\nto him and his parents, and he had shaken his head.

But she regretted the question when Tariq looked down and said, a bit \\ndistractedly, \"Passed on.\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m so sorry.\"  \\n \\n  \"Well. Yes. Me too. Here.\" He fished a small paper bag from his pocket and passed it to \\nher. \"Compliments of Alyona.\" Inside was a block of cheese in plastic wrap.  \\n \\n  \"Alyona. It\\'s a pretty name.\" Laila tried to say this next without wavering. \" Your wife?\"  \\n \\n  \"My goat.\" He was smiling at her expectantly, as though waiting for her to retrieve a \\nmemory.  \\n \\n  Then Laila remembered. The Soviet film. Alyona had been the captain\\'s daughter, the girl \\nin love with the first mate. That was the day that she,  Tariq, and Hasina had watched Soviet \\ntanks and jeeps leave Kabul, the day Tariq had worn that ridiculous Russian fur hat.  \\n \\n  \"I had to tie her to a stake in the ground,\" Tariq was saying. \"And build a fence. Because \\nof the wolves. In the foothills where I  live, there\\'s a wooded area nearby, maybe a quarter \\nof a mile away, pine trees mostly, some fir, deodars. They mostly stick to the woods, the \\nwolves do, but a bleating goat, one that likes to go wandering, that can draw them out. So \\nthe fence. The stake.\"  \\n \\n  Laila asked him which foothills.  \\n  \"Pir PanjaL Pakistan,\" he said \"Where I live is called Murree; it\\'s a summer retreat, an \\nhour from Islamabad. It\\'s hilly and green, lots of trees, high above sea level So it\\'s cool in \\nthe summer. Perfect for tourists. \" \\n \\n  The British had built it as a hill station near their military headquarters in Rawalpindi, he \\nsaid, for the Victorians to escape the heat. You could still spot a few relics of the colonial \\ntimes, Tariq said, the occasional tearoom, tin roofed bungalow s, called cottages, that sort of \\nthing. The town itself was small and pleasant. The main street was called the Mall, where \\nthere was a post office, a bazaar, a few restaurants, shops that overcharged tourists for \\npainted glass and hand knotted  carpets. Cur iously, the Mall\\'s one way traffic flowed in one \\ndirection one week, the opposite direction the next week.  \\n \\n  \"The locals say that Ireland\\'s traffic is like that too in places,\" Tariq said. \"I wouldn\\'t know. \\nAnyway, it\\'s nice.

After the war, the Soviets fell apart, and the West moved on. \\nThere was nothing at stake for them in Afghanistan anymore and the money dried up. Now \\nNasir Bagh is tents, dust, and open sewers.

She \\nwould wake up all nigh t long, feverish, coughing out thick, rust colored phlegm. The \\nqueues were long to see the doctor, Tariq said.

As though there was some accountant up \\nthere somewhere, a guy with a pencil tucked behind his ear who kept track of these things, \\nwho tallied things up, and he\\'d look down and say, \\'Yes, yes, he can have this, we\\'ll let it go. \\nHe\\'s paid some dues already, this one.\\'\"  \\n  It was in the seams, the hashish, and it spilled all over the street when the police took a \\nknife to the coat.  \\n \\n  Tariq laughed again when he said this, a climbing, shaky kind of laugh, and Laila \\nremembered how he used to l augh like this when they were little, to cloak embarrassment, \\nto make light of things he\\'d done that were foolhardy or scandalous.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  \"He has A limp,\" Zalmai said. \"Is this who I  think  it is?\"  \\n \\n  \"He was only visiting,\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n  \"Shut up, you ,\" Rasheed snapped, raising a finger. He turned back to Laila. \"Well, what \\ndo you know? Laili and Majnoon reunited. Just like old times.\" His face turned stony. \"So \\nyou let him in. Here. In my house. You let him in. He was in here with my son.\"  \\n  \"You dupe d me. You lied to me,\" Laila said, gritting her teeth. \"You had that man sit \\nacross from me and… You knew I would leave if I thought he was alive.\"  \\n \\n  \"AND YOU DIDN\\'T LIE TO ME?\" Rasheed roared. \"You think I didn\\'t figure it out? \\nAbout your  harami ?

The \\nsilence that would follow, the signal that it was her turn to give account, to provide the why \\nand how and when, to make official what h e surely already knew. She felt a faint nausea \\nwhenever he paused. She averted his eyes. She looked down at his hands, at the coarse, \\ndark hairs that had sprouted on the back of them in the intervening years.  \\n '),\n",

When Laila asked, he gave an impatient shake of his head. In this gesture, Laila saw \\nrusty bars and unwashed bodies, violent men and crowded halls, and ceilings rotting with \\nmoldy deposits. She read in his face that it had been a place of abasement, of degradation \\nand despair.  \\n \\n  Tariq said his mother tried to visit him after his arrest.  \\n \\n  \"Three times she came. But I never got to see her,\" he said.  \\n \\n  He wrote her a letter, and a few more after that, even though he doubted that she would \\nreceive them.  \\n \\n  \"And I wrote you.\"  \\n \\n  \"You did?\"  \\n \\n  \"Oh, volumes,\"  he said. \"Your friend Rumi would have envied my production.\" Then he \\nlaughed again, uproariously this time, as though he was both startled at his own boldn ess \\nand embarrassed by what he had let on.  \\n \\n  Zalmai began bawling upstairs.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  \"Just like old times, then,\" Rasheed said. \"The two of you.

There was always someone who was cunning and \\nconnected, who worked the system and found you things, someone around whom the air \\nbuzzed with both opportunity and danger It was Salim who had sent out Tariq\\'s queries \\nabout his mother, Salim who ha d sat him down and told him, in a soft, fatherly voice, that \\nshe had died of exposure.  \\n  Tariq spent seven years in the Pakistani prison. \"I got off easy,\" he said. \"I was lucky. The \\njudge sitting on my case, it turned out, had a brother who\\'d married an A fghan woman. \\nMaybe he showed mercy. I don\\'t know.\"  \\n \\n  When Tariq\\'s sentence was up, early in the winter of 2000, Salim gave him his brother\\'s \\naddress and phone number. The brother\\'s name was Sayeed.  \\n \\n  \"He said Sayeed owned a small hotel in Murree,\" Tariq said. \"Twenty rooms and a lounge, \\na little place to cater to tourists. He said tell him I sent you.\"  \\n \\n  Tariq had liked Murree as soon as he\\'d stepped off the bus: the snow laden pines; the cold, \\ncrisp air; the shuttered wooden cottages, smoke curling up f rom chimneys.  \\n  Here was a place, Tariq had thought, knocking on Sayeed\\'s door, a place not only worlds \\nremoved from the wretchedness he\\'d known but one that made even the notion of hardship \\nand sorrow somehow obscene, unimaginable.  \\n \\n  \"I said to myself, h ere is a place where a man can get on.\"  \\n \\n  Tariq was hired as a janitor and handyman. He did well, he said, during the one month \\ntrial period, at half pay, that Sayeed granted him. As Tariq spoke, Laila saw Sayeed, whom \\nshe imagined narrow eyed and ruddy f aced, standing at the reception office window \\nwatching Tariq chop wood and shovel snow off the driveway. She saw him stooping over \\nTariq\\'s legs, observing, as Tariq lay beneath the sink fixing a leaky pipe. She pictured him \\nchecking the register for missin g cash.  \\n \\n  Tariq\\'s shack was beside the cook\\'s little bungalow, he said. The cook was a matronly old \\nwidow named Adiba. Both shacks were detached from the hotel itself, separated from the \\nmain building by a scattering of almond trees, a park bench, and a p yramid shaped stone \\nfountain that, in the summer, gurgled water all day. Laila pictured Tariq in his shack, sitting \\nup in bed, watching the leafy world outside his window.  \\n \\n  At the end of the grace period, Sayeed raised Tariq\\'s pay to full, told him his l unches were \\nfree, gave him a wool coat, and fitted him for a new leg. Tariq said he\\'d wept at the man\\'s \\nkindness.  \\n \\n  With his first month\\'s full salary in his pocket, Tariq had gone to town and bought Alyona.  \\n \\n  \"Her fur is perfectly white,\" Tariq said, sm iling. \"Some mornings, when it\\'s snowed all \\nnight, you look out the window and all you see of her is two eyes and a muzzle.\"  \\n \\n  Laila nodded Another silence ensued Upstairs, Zalmai had begun bouncing his ball again '),\n",

You told me.\"  \\n \\n  Laila\\'s voice broke. She had to clear her throat, collect herself. \"The man who came to \\ngive the news, he was so earnest…I  believed him, Tariq. I wish I hadn\\'t, but I did. And then \\nI felt so alone and scared.  Otherwise, I wouldn\\'t have agreed to marry Rasheed. I wouldn\\'t \\nhave…\"  \\n \\n  \"You don\\'t have to do this,\" he said softly, avoiding her eyes. There was no hidden \\nreproach, no recrimination, in the way he had said this. No suggestion of blame.  \\n \\n  \"But I do. Bec ause there was a bigger reason why I married him. There\\'s something you \\ndon\\'t know, Tariq.  Someone.  I have to tell you.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  \"Did you s it and talk with him too?\" Rasheed asked Zalmai.  \\n  Zalmai said nothing. Laila saw hesitation and uncertainty in his  eyes now, as if he had just \\nrealized that what he\\'d disclosed had turned out to be far bigger than he\\'d thought.  \\n \\n  \"I asked you a question, boy.\"  \\n \\n  Zalmai swallowed. His gaze kept shifting. \"I was upstairs, playing with Mariam.\"  \\n  \"And your mother?\"  \\n \\n  Zalmai looked at Laila apologetically, on the verge of tears.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s all right, Zalmai,\" Laila said. \"Tell the truth.\"  \\n \\n  \"She was…She was downstairs, talking to that man,\" he said in a thin voice hardly louder \\nthan a whisper.  \\n \\n  \"I see,\" said Rasheed. \" Teamwork.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  As he was leaving, Tariq said, \"I want to meet her. I want to see her.\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'ll arrange it,\" Laila said.  \\n \\n  \"Aziza. Aziza.\" He smiled, tasting the word. Whenever Rasheed uttered her daughter\\'s \\nname, it came out sounding unwholesome to  Laila, almost vulgar.  \\n  \"Aziza. It\\'s lovely.\"  '),\n",

You\\'ll see.\"  \\n \\n  \"I\\'ll count the minutes.\"  \\n \\n  Almost ten years had passed since they had last seen each other. Laila\\'s mind flashed to all \\nthe times they\\'d met in the alley, kissing in secret. Sh e wondered how she must seem to him \\nnow. Did he still find her pretty? Or did she seem withered to him, reduced, pitiable, like a \\nfearful, shuffling old woman? Almost ten years. But, for a moment, standing there with \\nTariq in the sunlight, it was as though  those years had never happened. Her parents\\' deaths, \\nher marriage to Rasheed, the killings, the rockets, the Taliban, the beatings, the hunger, \\neven her children, all of it seemed like a dream, a bizarre detour, a mere interlude between \\nthat last afternoo n together and this moment.  \\n \\n  Then Tariq\\'s face changed, turned grave. She knew this expression. It was the same look \\nhe\\'d had on his face that day, all those years ago when they\\'d both been children, when he\\'d \\nunstrapped his leg and gone after Khadim. He  reached with one hand now and touched the \\ncomer of her lower lip.  \\n \\n  \"He did this to you,\" he said coldly.  \\n \\n  At his touch, Laila remembered the frenzy of that afternoon again when they\\'d conceived \\nAziza. His breath on her neck, the muscles of his hips fl exing, his chest pressing against her \\nbreasts, their hands interlocked.  \\n \\n  \"I wish I\\'d taken you with me,\" Tariq nearly whispered.  \\n \\n  Laila had to lower her gaze, try not to cry.  \\n \\n  \"I know you\\'re a married woman and a mother now. And here I am, after all these years, \\nafter all that\\'s happened, showing up at your doorstep. Probably, it isn\\'t proper, or fair, but \\nI\\'ve come such a long way to see you, and… Oh, Laila, I wish I\\'d never left you.\"  \\n \\n  \"Don\\'t,\" she croaked.  \\n \\n  \"I should have tried harder. I should  have married you when I had the chance. Everything \\nwould have been different, then.\"  \\n  \"Don\\'t talk this way. Please. It hurts.\"  \\n \\n  He nodded, started to take a step toward her, then stopped himself. \"I don\\'t want to assume \\nanything. And I don\\'t mean to tu rn your life upside down, appearing like this out of \\nnowhere. If you want me to leave, if you want me to go back to Pakistan, say the word, \\nLaila. I mean it.

She watched the folds clear from his brow. \\nSuspicion and misgiving winked out of his eyes. He sat up straight, and, for a few brief \\nmoments, he appeared merely thoughtful, like a captain informed of imminent mutiny \\ntaking his time to ponder his next move . \\n  He looked up.  \\n \\n  Mariam began to say something, but he raised a hand, and, without looking at her, said, \\n\"It\\'s too late, Mariam.\"  \\n \\n  To Zalmai he said coldly, \"You\\'re going upstairs, boy.\"  \\n \\n  On Zalmai\\'s face, Mariam saw alarm. Nervously, he looked aro und at the three of them. \\nHe sensed now that his tattletale game had let something serious adult serious into the room. \\nHe cast a despondent, contrite glance toward Mariam, then his mother.  \\n \\n  In a challenging voice, Rasheed said,  \"Now!\"  \\n \\n  He took Zalmai by the elbow.

Neither one of them \\nsaid a word. They listened to the footsteps in the hallway above, one heavy and foreboding, \\nthe other the p attering of a skittish little animal. They listened to muted words passed, a \\nsqueaky plea, a curt retort, a door shut, the rattle of a key as it turned. Then one set of \\nfootsteps returning, more impatiently now.  \\n \\n  Mariam saw his feet pounding the steps as  he came down. She saw him pocketing the key, \\nsaw his belt, the perforated end wrapped tightly around his knuckles. The fake brass buckle \\ndragged behind him, bouncing on the steps.  \\n \\n  She went to stop him, but he shoved her back and blew by her. Without sa ying a word, he \\nswung the belt at Laila. He did it with such speed that she had no time to retreat or duck, or \\neven raise a protective arm.

She missed, \\nand Rasheed brought the belt down again. Laila  caught it briefly before Rasheed yanked it \\nfree and lashed at her again. Then Laila was dashing around the room, and Mariam was \\nscreaming words that ran together and imploring Rasheed, as he chased Laila, as he \\nblocked her way and cracked his belt at her.  At one point, Laila ducked and managed to \\nland a punch across his ear, which made him spit a curse and pursue her even more \\nrelentlessly. He caught her, threw her up against the wall, and struck her with the belt again \\nand again, the buckle slamming again st her chest, her shoulder, her raised arms, her fingers, \\ndrawing blood wherever it struck.  \\n \\n  Mariam lost count of how many times the belt cracked, how many pleading words she \\ncried out to Rasheed, how many times she circled around the incoherent tangle o f teeth and \\nfists and belt, before she saw fingers clawing at Rasheed's face, chipped nails digging into \\nhis jowls and pulling at his hair and scratching his forehead. How long before she realized, \\nwith both shock and relish, that the fingers were hers.  \\n \\n  He let go of Laila and turned on her. At first, he looked at her without seeing her, then his \\neyes narrowed, appraised Mariam with interest. The look in them shifted from puzzlement \\nto shock, then disapproval, disappointment even, lingering there a moment . \\n \\n  Mariam remembered the first time she had seen his eyes, under the wedding veil, in the \\nmirror, with Jalil looking on, how their gazes had slid across the glass and met, his \\nindifferent, hers docile, conceding, almost apologetic.  \\n \\n  Apologetic.  \\n \\n  Mari am saw now in those same eyes what a fool she had been.  \\n  Had she been a deceitful wife? she asked herself. A complacent wife? A dishonorable \\nwoman? Discreditable? Vulgar? What harmful thing had she willfully done to this man to \\nwarrant his malice, his con tinual assaults, the relish with which he tormented her? Had she \\nnot looked after him when he was ill? Fed him, and his friends, cleaned up after him \\ndutifully?  \\n \\n  Had she not given this man her youth?  \\n  Had she ever justly deserved his meanness?  \\n \\n  The be lt made a thump when Rasheed dropped it to the ground and came for her. Some \\njobs, that  thump  said, were meant to be done with bare hands.  \\n \\n  But just as he was bearing down on her, Mariam saw Laila behind him pick something up \\nfrom the ground. She watched  Laila's hand rise overhead, hold, then come swooping down \\nagainst the side of his face. Glass shattered. The jagged remains of the drinking glass rained \\ndown to the ground. There was blood on Laila's hands, blood flowing from the open gash \"),\n",

He turned around, all snarling teeth \\nand blazing eyes.  \\n \\n  They crashed to the ground, Rasheed and Laila, thrashing about. He ended up on top, his \\nhands already wrapped around Laila\\'s neck.  \\n \\n  Mariam clawed at him. Sh e beat at his chest. She hurled herself against him. She struggled \\nto uncurl his fingers from Laila\\'s neck. She bit them. But they remained tightly clamped \\naround Laila\\'s wind pipe, and Mariam saw that he meant to carry this through.  \\n \\n  He meant to suffoca te her, and there was nothing either of them could do about it.  \\n  Mariam backed away and left the room. She was aware of a thumping sound from upstairs, \\naware that tiny palms were slapping against a locked door. She ran down the hallway. She \\nburst through the front door. Crossed the yard.  \\n \\n  In the toolshed, Mariam grabbed the shovel.  \\n  Rasheed didn\\'t notice her coming back into the room. He was still on top of Laila, his eyes \\nwide and crazy, his hands wrapped around her neck. Laila\\'s face was turning blue now, and \\nher eyes had rolled back. Mariam saw that she was no longer struggling. He\\'s going to kill \\nher, she thought.  He really means to.  And Mariam could not, would not, allow that to \\nhappen. He\\'d taken so much from her in twenty seven years of marriage. S he would not \\nwatch him take Laila too.  \\n \\n  Mariam steadied her feet and tightened her grip around the shovel\\'s handle. She raised it. \\nShe said his name. She wanted him to see.  \\n \\n  \"Rasheed.\"  \\n \\n  He looked up.  \\n  Mariam swung.  \\n  She hit him across the temple. T he blow knocked him off Laila.  \\n \\n  Rasheed touched his head with the palm of his hand. He looked at the blood on his \\nfingertips, then at Mariam. She thought she saw his face soften. She imagined that \\nsomething had passed between them, that maybe she had qui te literally knocked some \\nunderstanding into his head. Maybe he saw something in her face too, Mariam thought, \\nsomething that made him hedge. Maybe he saw some trace of all the self denial, all the \\nsacrifice, all the sheer exertion it had taken her to live  with him for all these years, live with \\nhis continual condescension and violence, his faultfinding and meanness. Was that respect \\nshe saw in his eyes? Regret?  \\n \\n  But then his upper lip curled back into a spiteful sneer, and Mariam knew then the futility, \\nmaybe even the irresponsibility, of not finishing this. If she let him walk now, how long \\nbefore he fetched the key from his pocket and went for that gun of his upstairs in the room \\nwhere he\\'d locked Zalmai?

Laila thought \\nof all the times she had tied a  rag around the end of a broom and cleaned cobwebs from this \\nceiling. The three times she and Mariam had put coats of white paint on it. The crack wasn't \\na smile any longer now but a mocking leer. And it was receding. The ceiling was shrinking, \\nlifting, ri sing away from her and toward some hazy dimness beyond. It rose until it shrank \\nto the size of a postage stamp, white and bright, everything around it blotted out by the \\nshuttered darkness. In the dark, Rasheed's face was like a sunspot.  \\n \\n  Brief little bu rsts of blinding light before her eyes now, like silver stars exploding. Bizarre \\ngeometric forms in the light, worms, egg shaped things, moving up and down, sideways, \\nmelting into each other, breaking apart, morphing into something else, then fading, givin g \\nway to blackness.  \\n \\n  Voices muffled and distant.  \\n \\n  Behind the lids of her eyes, her children's faces flared and fizzled.

What a pitiable end But then the darkness \\nbegan to lift. She had a sensation of rising up, of being hoisted up. The ceiling slowly came \\nback, expanded, and now Laila could make out the crack again, and it was the same old \\ndull smile.  \\n \\n  She was being shaken.  Are you all right? Answer me, are you all right?  Mariam's face, \\nengraved with scratches, heavy with worry, hovered over Laila.  \\n \\n  Laila tried a breath. It burned her throat. She tried another.

Mariam\\'s face looked thin and \\ndrawn in  this light, but she did not appear agitated or frightened, merely preoccupied, \\nthoughtful, so self possessed that when a fly landed on her chin she paid it no attention.

They had to back up and try again, and then \\nsomething thumped upstairs and Laila\\'s legs gave out. She dropped Rasheed. She slumped \\nto the ground, sobbing and shaking, and Mariam had to stand over her, hands on hips, and \\nsay that she had  to get herself together. That what was done was done After a time, Laila \\ngot up and wiped her face, and they carried Rasheed to the yard without further incident. \\nThey took him into the toolshed. They left him behind the workbench, on which sat his saw, \\nsome nails, a chisel, a hammer, and a cylindrical block of wood that Rasheed had been \\nmeaning to carve into something for Zalmai but had never gotten around to doing Then \\nthey went back inside. Mariam washed her hands, ran them through her hair, took a deep  \\nbreath and let it out. \"Let me tend to your wounds now. You\\'re all cut up, Laila jo.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mariam said she needed the night to think things over. To get her thoughts together and \\ndevise a plan.  \\n '),\n",

We can\\'t stay here,\" Laila said in a broken, husky voice. She thought \\nsuddenly of the sound the shovel must have made striking Rasheed\\'s head, and her body \\npitched forward. Bile surged up her chest.  \\n \\n  Mariam waited patiently unt il Laila felt better. Then she had Laila lie down, and, as she \\nstroked Laila\\'s hair in her lap, Mariam said not to worry, that everything would be fine. She \\nsaid that they would leave she, Laila, the children, and Tariq too. They would leave this \\nhouse, an d this unforgiving city. They would leave this despondent country altogether, \\nMariam said, running her hands through Laila\\'s hair, and go someplace remote and safe \\nwhere no one would find them, where they could disown their past and find shelter.  \\n  \"Somewh ere with trees,\" she said. \"Yes. Lots of trees.\"  \\n \\n  They would live in a small house on the edge of some town they\\'d never heard of, Mariam \\nsaid, or in a remote village where the road was narrow and unpaved but lined with all \\nmanner of plants and shrubs. M aybe there would be a path to take, a path that led to a grass \\nfield where the children could play, or maybe a graveled road that would take them to a \\nclear blue lake where trout swam and reeds poked through the surface. They would raise \\nsheep and chickens , and they would make bread together and teach the children to read. \\nThey would make new lives for themselves peaceful, solitary lives and there the weight of \\nall that they\\'d endured would lift from them, and they would be deserving of all the \\nhappiness an d simple prosperity they would find.  \\n \\n  Laila murmured encouragingly. It would be an existence rife with difficulties, she saw, \\nbut of a pleasurable kind, difficulties they could take pride in, possess, value, as one would \\na family heirloom. Mariam\\'s soft maternal voice went on, brought a degree of comfort to \\nher. There is a way,  she\\'d said, and, in the morning, Mariam would tell her what needed to \\nbe done and they would do it, and maybe by tomorrow this time they would be on their way \\nto this new life, a l ife luxuriant with possibility and joy and welcomed difficulties. Laila \\nwas grateful that Mariam was in charge, unclouded and sober, able to think this through for \\nboth of them. Her own mind was a jittery, muddled mess.  \\n \\n  Mariam got up. \"You should tend t o your son now.\" On her was the most stricken \\nexpression Laila had ever seen on a human face.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Laila found him in the dark, curled up on Rasheed\\'s  side of the mattress . She slipped \\nbeneath the covers beside him and pulled the blanket over them.  \\n \\n  \"Are you asleep?\"  \\n \\n  Without turning around to face her, he said, \"Can\\'t sleep yet.

Laila wondered miserably. How many more times would \\nZalmai have to be deceived? She pictured Zalmai, his jubilant, running welcomes when \\nRasheed came home and Rasheed picking him up by the elbows and swinging him round \\nand round until Zalmai\\'s legs flew st raight out, the two of them giggling afterward when \\nZalmai stumbled around like a drunk. She thought of their disorderly games and their \\nboisterous laughs, their secretive glances.  \\n  A pall of shame and grief for her son fell over Laila.  \\n \\n  \"Where did he g o?\" \\n  \"I don\\'t know, my love.\"  \\n \\n  When was he coming back? Would Baba jan bring a present with him when he returned?  \\n \\n  She did the prayers with Zalmai. Twenty one  Bismallah -e-rahman erahims  one for each \\nknuckle of seven fingers. She watched him cup his ha nds before his face and blow into \\nthem, then place the back of both hands on his forehead and make a casting away motion, \\nwhispering, Babaloo,  be gone, do not come to Zalmai, he has no business with you.  \\nBabaloo,  be gone.  Then, to finish off, they said  Ailah u akbar  three times. And later, much \\nlater that night, Laila was startled by a muted voice:  Did Babajan leave because of me? \\nBecause of what I said, about you and the man downstairs?  \\n \\n  She leaned over him, meaning to reassure, meaning to say  It had not hing to do with you, \\nZalmai. No. Nothing is your fault.  But he was asleep, his small chest rising and sinking.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  When Laila \"went to bed, her mind was muffled up, clouded, incapable of sustained \\nrational thought. But when she woke up, to the muezzi n\\'s call for morning prayer, much of \\nthe dullness had lifted.  \\n \\n  She sat up and watched Zalmai sleep for a while, the ball of his fist under his chin. Laila \\npictured Mariam sneaking into the room in the middle of the night as she and Zalmai had \\nslept, watc hing them, making plans in her head.  \\n \\n  Laila slipped out of bed. It took effort to stand. She ached everywhere. Her neck, her \\nshoulders, her back, her arms, her thighs, all engraved with the cuts of Rasheed\\'s belt '),\n",

Wincing, she quietly left the bed room.  \\n \\n  In Mariam\\'s room, the light was a shade darker than gray, the kind of light Laila had \\nalways associated with crowing roosters and dew rolling off blades of grass.

The trees, the lake, the nameless village. A delusion, she saw. A \\nlovely lie meant to soothe. Like cooing to a distressed child.  \\n \\n  \"I meant it,\" Mariam said. \"I meant it for you, Laila jo.\"  \\n \\n  \"I don\\'t want any of it without you,\" Laila croaked.  \\n \\n  Mariam smiled wanly.  \\n \\n  \"I want it to be just like you said, Mariam, all of us going together, you, me, the children. \\nTariq has a place in Pakistan.

No. I\\'ll take  careof you  for a change.\"  \\n \\n  \"Oh, Laila jo.\"  \\n \\n  Laila went on a stammering rant. She bargained. She promised. She would do all the \\ncleaning, she said, and all the cooking. \"You won\\'t have to do a thing. Ever again. You rest, \\nsleep in, plant a garden. What ever you want, you ask and I\\'ll get it for you. Don\\'t do this, \\nMariam. Don\\'t leave me.

She remembered all the \\nafternoons th ey\\'d spent together, braiding each other\\'s hair, Mariam listening patiently to \\nher random thoughts and ordinary stories with an air of gratitude, with the expression of a \\nperson to whom a unique and coveted privilege had been extended \"It is fair,\" Mariam s aid. \\n\"I\\'ve killed our husband. I\\'ve deprived your son of his father. It isn\\'t right that I run.

This is all right. Don\\'t be sad.\"  \\n \\n  Laila could find no reasonable answer for anything Mariam said. But she rambled on \\nanyway, incoherently, childishly, about fruit trees that awaited planting and chickens that \\nawaited raising. She went on about small houses in unnamed towns, and walks to trout \\nfilled lakes. And, in the end, when the words dried up, the tears did not, and all Laila could \\ndo was surrender and sob like a child over whelmed by an adult\\'s unassailable l ogic. All she \\ncould do was roll herself up and bury her face one last time in the welcoming warmth of \\nMariam\\'s lap.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Later that morning, Mariam packed Zalmai a small lunch of bread and dried figs.

It sat in the center of a larger complex that housed male inmates. A \\npadlocked door separated Mariam and the other women from the surrou nding men. Mariam \\ncounted five working cells. They were unfurnished rooms, with dirty, peeling walls, and \\nsmall windows that looked into the courtyard. The windows were barred, even though the \\ndoors to the cells were unlocked and the women were free to com e and go to the courtyard \\nas they pleased. The windows had no glass. There were no curtains either, which meant the \\nTalib guards who roamed the courtyard had an eyeful of the interior of the cells. Some of \\nthe women complained that the guards smoked outsid e the window and leered in, with their \\ninflamed eyes and wolfish smiles, that they muttered indecent jokes to each other about \\nthem. Because of this, most of the women wore burqas all day and lifted them only after \\nsundown, after the main gate was locked a nd the guards had gone to their posts.  \\n \\n  At night, the cell Mariam shared with five women and four children was dark. On those \\nnights when there was electrical power, they hoisted Naghma, a short, flat chested girl with \\nblack frizzy hair, up to the ceilin g. There was a wire there from which the coating had been \\nstripped. Naghma would hand wrap the live wire around the base of the lightbulb then to \\nmake a circuit.  \\n \\n  The toilets were closet sized, the cement floor cracked There was a small, rectangular hole  \\nin the ground, at the bottom of which was a heap of feces. Flies buzzed in and out of the \\nhole In the middle of the prison was an open, rectangular courtyard, and, in the middle of \\nthat, a well The well had no drainage, meaning the courtyard was often a s wamp and the \\nwater tasted rotten. Laundry lines, loaded with hand washed  socks and diapers, slashed \\nacross each other in the courtyard. This was where inmates met visitors, where they boiled \\nthe rice their families brought them the prison provided no food The courtyard was also the \\nchildren\\'s playground Mariam had learned that many of the children had been born in \\nWalayat, had never seen the world outside these walls. Mariam watched them chase each \\nother around, watched their shoeless feet sling mud. All da y, they ran around, making up \\nlively games, unaware of the stench of feces and urine that permeated Walayat and their \\nown bodies, unmindful of the Talib guards until one smacked them.  \\n \\n  Mariam had no visitors. That was the first and only thing she had ask ed the Talib officials \\nhere. No visitors.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  None of the women in Mariam\\'s cell were serving time for violent crime they were all \\nthere for the common offense of \"running away from home.\" As a result, Mariam gained \\nsome notoriety among them, became a kind of celebrity.

Naghma was the sort of person who found it entertaining to dispense \\nnews of misfortune, whether others\\' or her own. She said her father had promised her to a \\ntailor some thirty years older than her.  \\n  \"He smells  like goh,  and has fewer teeth t han fingers,\" Naghma said of the tailor.  \\n  She\\'d tried to elope to Gardez with a young man she\\'d fallen in love with, the son of a \\nlocal mullah. They\\'d barely made it out of Kabul. When they were caught and sent back, \\nthe mullah\\'s son was flogged before he  repented and said that Naghma had seduced him \\nwith her feminine charms. She\\'d cast a spell on him, he said. He promised he would \\nrededicate himself to the study of the Koran. The mullah\\'s son was freed. Naghma was \\nsentenced to five years.  \\n \\n  It was just a s well, she said, her being here in prison. Her father had sworn that the day \\nshe was released he would take a knife to her throat.  \\n \\n  Listening to Naghma, Mariam remembered the dim glimmer of cold stars and the stringy \\npink clouds streaking over the Safid  koh mountains that long ago morning when Nana had \\nsaid to her,  Like a compass needle that points north, a man\\'s accusing finger always finds a \\nwoman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mariam\\'s trial had taken place the week before. There was no  legal council, no public \\nhearing, no cross examining of evidence, no appeals. Mariam declined her right to \\nwitnesses. The entire thing lasted less than fifteen minutes.  \\n \\n  The middle judge, a brittle looking Talib, was the leader. He was strikingly gaunt,  with \\nyellow, leathery skin and a curly red beard. He wore eyeglasses that magnified his eyes and \\nrevealed how yellow the whites were. His neck looked too thin to support the intricately \\nwrapped turban on his head.  \\n  \"You admit to this,  hamshira?I  he asked  again in a tired voice.  \\n \\n  \"I do,\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n  The man nodded. Or maybe he didn\\'t. It was hard to tell; he had a pronounced shaking of \\nhis hands and head that reminded Mariam of Mullah Faizullah\\'s tremor. When he sipped tea, \\nhe did not reach for his c up. He motioned to the square shouldered man to his left, who \\nrespectfully brought it to his lips. After, the Talib closed his eyes gently, a muted and \\nelegant gesture of gratitude.  \\n \\n  Mariam found a disarming quality about him. When he spoke, it was with a tinge of guile \\nand tenderness. His smile was patient. He did not look at Mariam despisingly. He did not \\naddress her with spite or accusation but with a soft tone of apology.  \\n '),\n",

This one was the youngest of the three. He spoke quickly and with \\nemphatic, arrogant confidence. He\\'d been irritated that Mariam could not speak Pashto. He \\nstruck Mariam as the sort of quarrelsome young man who relished  his authority, who saw \\noffenses everywhere, thought it his birthright to pass judgment.  \\n \\n  \"I do understand,\" Mariam said.  \\n \\n  \"I wonder,\" the young Talib said. \"God has made us differently, you women and us men. \\nOur brains are different. You are not able to think like we can. Western doctors and their \\nscience have proven this.

I saw him a month \\nago, and then again last week. I said, tell me the truth, friend, and he said to me, three \\nmonths, Mullah sahib, maybe six at most all God\\' s will, of course.\"  \\n  He nodded discreetly at the square shouldered man on his left and took another sip of the \\ntea he was offered. He wiped his mouth with the back of his tremulous hand. \"It does not \\nfrighten me to leave this life that my only son left fi ve years ago, this life that insists we \\nbear sorrow upon sorrow long after we can bear no more.

She said she did.  \\n \\n  \"May Allah forgive you.\"  \\n \\n  Before they led her out, Mariam was given a document, told to sign beneath her statement \\nand the mullah\\'s senten ce. As the three Taliban watched, Mariam wrote it out, her name the  \\nmeem,  the reh, the  yah, and the  meem  remembering the last time she\\'d signed her name to a \\ndocument, twenty seven years before, at Jalil\\'s table, beneath the watchful gaze of another \\nmullah . \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Mariam spent ten days in prison. She sat by the window of the cell, watched the prison life \\nin the courtyard. When the summer winds blew, she watched bits of scrap paper ride the \\ncurrents in a frenzied, corkscrew motion, as they were hurled thi s way and that, high above \\nthe prison walls. She watched the winds stir mutiny in the dust, whipping it into violent \\nspirals that ripped through the courtyard. Everyone the guards, the inmates, the children, \\nMariam burrowed their faces in the hook of their  elbows, but the dust would not be denied. \\nIt made homes of ear canals and nostrils, of eyelashes and skin folds, of the space between \\nmolars.

She put it in Mariam\\'s \\npalm and closed her fingers around it. Then she burst into tears.  \\n  \"You\\'re the best friend I ever had,\" she said.  \\n \\n  Mariam spent the r est of the day by the barred window watching the inmates below. \\nSomeone was cooking a meal, and a stream of cumin scented smoke and warm air wafted \\nthrough the window. Mariam could see the children playing a blindfolded game.

Mullah Faizullah twirling his rosary beads, walking with \\nher along the stream, their twin shadows gliding on the water and on the grassy banks \\nsprinkled with a blue lavender wild iris that, in this dream, smelled like cloves. She \\ndreamed of Nana in the doorway of the kolba , her voice dim and distant, calling her to \\ndinner, as Mariam played in cool, tangled grass where ants crawled and beetles scurried and \\ngrasshoppers skipped amid all the different shades of green.  The squeak of a wheelbarrow \\nlaboring up a dusty path. Cowbells clanging. Sheep baaing on a hill.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  On the way to Ghazi Stadium, Mariam bounced in the bed of the truck as it skidded \\naround potholes and  its wheels spat pebbles.

In the crowded bleachers, necks were craned for the \\nbenefit of a better view. Tongues clucked. A murmuring sound rippled through the stadium \\nwhen Mariam was helped down from the truck. Mariam imagined heads shaking when the \\nloudspeaker announced her crime. But she did not look up to see whether they were \\nshaki ng with disapproval or charity, with reproach or pity. Mariam blinded herself to them \\nall. \\n \\n  Earlier that morning, she had been afraid that she would make a fool of herself, that she \\nwould turn into a pleading, weeping spectacle. She had feared that she m ight scream or \\nvomit or even wet herself, that, in her last moments, she would be betrayed by animal \\ninstinct or bodily disgrace. But when she was made to descend from the truck, Mariam's \\nlegs did not buckle. Her arms did not flail. She did not have to be dragged. And when she \\ndid feel herself faltering, she thought of Zalmai, from whom she had taken the love of his \\nlife, whose days now would be shaped by the sorrow of his father's disappearance. And \\nthen Mariam's stride steadied and she could walk without protest.  \\n \\n  An armed man approached her and told her to walk toward the southern goalpost. Mariam \\ncould sense the crowd tightening up with anticipation. She did not look up. She kept her \\neyes to the ground, on her shadow, on her executioner's shadow traili ng hers.  \\n \\n  Though there had been moments of beauty in it, Mariam knew that life for the most part \\nhad been unkind to her. But as she walked the final twenty paces, she could not help but \\nwish for more of it. She wished she could see Laila again, wished to  hear the clangor of her \\nlaugh, to sit with her once more for a pot of  chai and leftover  halwa  under a starlit sky. She \\nmourned that she would never see Aziza grow up, would not see the beautiful young \\nwoman that she would one day become, would not get to paint her hands with henna and \\ntoss noqul  candy at her wedding. She would never play with Aziza's children. She would \\nhave liked that very much, to be old and play with Aziza's children.  \\n  Near the goalpost, the man behind her asked her to stop. Mariam did . Through the \\ncrisscrossing grid of the burqa, she saw his shadow arms lift his shadow Kalashnikov.  \\n \\n  Mariam wished for so much in those final moments. Yet as she closed her eyes, it was not \\nregret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her. She thought of \\nher entry into this world, the  harami  child of a lowly villager, an unintended thing, a \\npitiable, regrettable accident. A weed. And yet she was leaving the world as a woman who \\nhad loved and been loved back. She was leaving it as a  friend, a companion, a guardian. A \\nmother. A person of consequence at last. No. It was not so bad, Mariam thought, that she \\nshould die this way. Not so bad. This was a legitimate end to a life of illegitimate \\nbeginnings.  \\n \\n  Mariam's final thoughts were a few words from the Koran, which she muttered under her \\nbreath.  \"),\n",

He says it feels like a butcher\\'s \\nknife burrowing in one temple, twisting slowly through his brain, then poking out the other \\nside. \\n \\n  \"I can taste the metal, even, when they begin.\"  \\n \\n  Sometimes Laila wets a cloth and lays it on his forehead and that helps a little. The little \\nround white pills Sayeed\\'s doctor gave Tariq help too. But some nights, all Tariq can do is \\nhold his head and moan, his eyes bloodshot, his nose dripping. Laila sits with him when \\nhe\\'s in the grip  of it like that, rubs the back of his neck, takes his hand in hers, the metal of \\nhis wedding band cold against her palm.  \\n \\n  They married the day that they arrived in Murree. Sayeed looked relieved when Tariq told \\nhim they would. He would not have to broac h with Tariq the delicate matter of an \\nunmarried couple living in his hotel. Sayeed is not at all as Laila had pictured him, ruddy \\nfaced and pea eyed. He has a salt and pepper mustache whose ends he rolls to a sharp tip, \\nand a shock of long gray hair combe d back from the brow. He is a soft spoken, mannerly \\nman, with measured speech and graceful movements.  \\n \\n  It was Sayeecl who summoned a friend and a mullah for the  nikka  that day, Sayeed who \\npulled Tariq aside and gave him money. Tariq wouldn\\'t take it, but  Sayeed insisted. Tariq \\nwent to the Mall then and came back with two simple, thin wedding bands. They married \\nlater that night, after the children had gone to bed.  \\n \\n  In the mirror, beneath the green veil that the mullah draped over their heads, Laila\\'s ey es \\nmet Tariq\\'s. There were no tears, no wedding day smiles, no whispered oaths of long \\nlasting love. In silence, Laila looked at their reflection, at faces that had aged beyond their \\nyears, at the pouches and lines and sags that now marked their once scrub bed, youthful \\nfaces. Tariq opened his mouth and began to say something, but, just as he did, someone \\npulled the veil, and Laila missed what it was that he was going to say.  \\n  That night, they lay in bed as husband and wife, as the children snored below the m on \\nsleeping cots. Laila remembered the ease with which they would crowd the air between \\nthem with words, she and Tariq, when they were younger, the haywire, brisk flow of their \\nspeech, always interrupting each other, tugging each other\\'s collar to emphas ize a point, the \\nquickness to laugh, the eagerness to delight. So much had happened since those childhood \\ndays, so much that needed to be said. But that first night the enormity of it all stole the \\nwords from her.

She likes the souvenir shops, and the various hotels that \\nhouse tourists, even as the locals bemoan the constant construction, the expansion of \\ninfrastructure that they say is eating away at Murree\\'s natural beauty. Laila finds it odd that \\npeople should lament the  building  of buildings. In Kabul, they would celebrate it.  \\n \\n  She likes that they have a bathroom, not an  outhouse but an actual bathroom, with a toilet \\nthat flushes, a shower, and a sink too, with twin faucets from which she can draw, with a \\nflick of her wrist, water, either hot or cold. She likes waking up to the sound of Alyona \\nbleating in the morning, and  the harmlessly cantankerous cook, Adiba, who works marvels \\nin the kitchen.  \\n \\n  Sometimes, as Laila watches Tariq sleep, as her children mutter and stir in their own sleep, \\na great big lump of gratitude catches in her throat, makes her eyes water.  \\n \\n  In the  mornings, Laila follows Tariq from room to room. Keys jingle from a ring clipped \\nto his waist and a spray bottle of window cleaner dangles from the belt loops of his jeans. \\nLaila brings a pail filled with rags, disinfectant, a toilet brush, and spray wax for the \\ndressers. Aziza tags along, a mop in one hand, the bean stuffed doll Mariam had made for \\nher in the other. Zalmai trails them reluctantly, sulkily, always a few steps behind.  \\n \\n  Laila vacuums, makes the bed, and dusts. Tariq washes the bathroom sin k and tub, scrubs \\nthe toilet and mops the linoleum floor. He stocks the shelves with clean towels, miniature \\nshampoo bottles, and bars of almond scented soap. Aziza has laid claim to the task of \\nspraying and wiping the windows. The doll is never far from w here she works.  \\n  Laila told Aziza about Tariq a few days after the  nikka  \\n  It is strange, Laila thinks, almost unsettling, the thing between Aziza and Tariq. Already, \\nAziza is finishing his sentences and he hers. She hands him things before he asks for th em. \\nPrivate smiles shoot between them across the dinner table as if they are not strangers at all \\nbut companions reunited after a lengthy separation.  \\n  Aziza looked down thoughtfully at her hands when Laila told her.  \\n \\n  \"I like him,\" she said, after a long  pause.  \\n \\n  \"He loves  you.\"  \\n '),\n",

From a prison inmate, he \\nlearned to make  paper animals, and so he has folded, cut, and tucked countless sheets of \\npaper into lions and kangaroos for Zalmai, into horses and brightly plumed birds. But these \\novertures are dismissed by Zalmai unceremoniously, sometimes venomously.  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re a donk ey!\" he cries. \"I don\\'t want your toys!\"  \\n \\n  \"Zalmai!\" Laila gasps.  \\n \\n  \"It\\'s all right,\" Tariq says. \"Laila, it\\'s all right. Let him.\"  \\n \\n  \"You\\'re not my Baba jan! My real Baba jan is away on a trip, and when he gets back he\\'s \\ngoing to beat you up! And you w on\\'t be able to run away, because he has two legs and you \\nonly have one!\"  \\n \\n  At night, Laila holds Zalmai against her chest and recites  Babaloo prayers with him. \\nWhen he asks, she tells him the lie again, tells him his Baba jan has gone away and she \\ndoesn\\' t know when he would come back. She abhors this task, abhors herself for lying like \\nthis to a child  \\n  Laila knows that this shameful lie will have to be told again and again. It will have to \\nbecause Zalmai will ask, hopping down from a swing, waking from a n afternoon nap, and, \\nlater, when he\\'s old enough to tie his own shoes, to walk to school by himself, the lie will \\nhave to be delivered again.  \\n \\n  At some point, Laila knows, the questions will dry up.

That it has become something else altogether, something more soft edged and \\nindolent. Like a lore. Something to be revered, mystified by.  \\n \\n  Laila is happy here in Murree. Bu t it is not an easy happiness. It is not a happiness without \\ncost. \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  On his days off, Tariq takes Laila and the children to the Mall, along which are shops that \\nsell trinkets and next to which is an Anglican church built in the mid nineteenth centu ry. \\nTariq buys them spicy  chapli  kebabs from street vendors. They stroll amid the crowds of \\nlocals, the Europeans and their cellular phones and digital cameras, the Punjabis who come \\nhere to escape the heat of the plains.  \\n \\n  Occasionally, they board a bus to Kashmir Point.

They stop by the old British \\ncemetery, or take a taxi up a mountain peak for a view of the verdant, fog shrouded valley \\nbelow.  \\n \\n  Sometimes on these outings, when they pass by a store window, Laila catches their \\nreflections in it.

Ahmad Shah Massoud. He\\'s \\ndead.\"  \\n \\n  \"What?\"  \\n \\n  From the doorway, Tariq tells her what he knows.  \\n \\n  \"They say he gave an interview to a pair of journalists who claim ed they were Belgians \\noriginally from Morocco.

Massoud leaning forward, one eyebrow cocked, his face furrowed in \\nconcentration, as though he was respectfully listening to someone. Laila remembers  how \\ngrateful Mammy was that Massoud had said a graveside prayer at her sons\\' burial, how she \\ntold everyone about it.

The work is not cumbersome, \\nand, on their days off, she and Tariq take the children to ride the chairlift to Patriata hill, \\nor go to Pindi Po int, where, on a clear day, you can see as far as Islamabad and downtown \\nRawalpindi.

It is, in fact, precisely the sort \\nof life she used to dream for herself in her darkest days with Rasheed. Every day, Laila \\nreminds herself of this.  \\n \\n  Then one warm night in July 2002, she and Tariq are lying in bed talking in hushed voices \\nabou t all the changes back home. There have been so many. The coalition forces have \\ndriven the Taliban out of every major city, pushed them across the border to Pakistan and to \\nthe mountains in the south and east of Afghanistan. ISAF, an international peacekee ping \\nforce, has been sent to Kabul. The country has an interim president now, Hamid Karzai.  \\n \\n  Laila decides that now is the time to tell Tariq.  \\n \\n  A year ago, she would have gladly given an arm to get out of Kabul. But in the last few \\nmonths, she has foun d herself missing the city of her childhood. She misses the bustle of \\nShor Bazaar, the Gardens of Babur, the call of the water carriers lugging their goatskin bags. \\nShe misses the garment hagglers at Chicken Street and the melon hawkers in Karteh \\nParwan.  \\n \\n  But it isn\\'t mere homesickness or nostalgia that has Laila thinking of Kabul so much these \\ndays. She has become plagued by restlessness. She hears of schools built in Kabul, roads \\nrepaved, women returning to work, and her life here, pleasant as it is, gr ateful as she is for \\nit, seems… insufficient to her. Inconsequential Worse yet, wasteful. Of late, she has started \\nhearing Babi\\'s voice in her head.  You can be anything you want, Laila,  he says.  I know this \\nabout you.

Laila has to explain to Aziza \\nthat when they return to Kabul the Taliban won\\'t be there, that there will not be any fighting, \\nand that she will not be sent back to the orphanage. \"We\\'ll all live together. Your father , me, \\nZalmai. And you, Aziza. You\\'ll never, ever, have to be apart from me again. I promise.\" \\nShe smiles at her daughter. \"Until the day  you want to, that is. When you fall in love with \\nsome young man and want to marry him.\"  \\n \\n  On the day they leave Murree , Zalmai is inconsolable.

We can\\'t take a goat on the bus,\" Laila explains again.  \\n \\n  It isn\\'t until Tariq kneels down beside h im, until he promises Zalmai that he will buy him \\na goat just like Alyona in Kabul, that Zalmai reluctantly lets go.  \\n \\n  There are tearful farewells with Sayeed as well For good luck, he holds a Koran by the \\ndoorway for Tariq, Laila, and the children to kis s three times, then holds it high so they can \\npass under it. He helps Tariq load the two suitcases into the trunk of his car. It is Sayeed \\nwho drives them to the station, who stands on the curb waving good bye as the bus sputters \\nand pulls away.  \\n \\n  As she leans back and watches Sayeed receding in the rear window of the bus, Laila hears \\nthe voice of doubt whispering in her head. Are they being foolish, she wonders, leaving \\nbehind the safety of Murree? Going back to the land where her parents and brothers \\nperished, where the smoke of bombs is only now settling?  \\n  And then, from the darkened spirals of her memory, rise two lines of poetry, Babi\\'s \\nfarewell ode to Kabul:  \\n \\n  One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns \\nthat hide behind her  walls.  \\n \\n  Laila settles back in her seat, blinking the wetness from her eyes.

This journey home is the right thing to do.  \\n  But first there is one last farewell to be said.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The wars in Afghanistan hav e ravaged the roads connecting Kabul, Herat, and Kandahar. \\nThe easiest way to Herat now is through Mashad, in Iran.

When the bus passes the shrine to Imam Reza, the eighth Shi\\'a imam, \\nLaila cranes her neck to get a better view of its glistening tiles, the minarets, the \\nmagnif icent golden dome, all of it immaculately and lovingly preserved. She thinks of the \\nBuddhas in her own country. They are grains of dust now, blowing about the Bamiyan \\nValley in the wind.  \\n \\n  The bus ride to the Iranian Afghan border takes almost ten hours. The terrain grows more \\ndesolate, more barren, as they near Afghanistan. Shortly before they cross the border into \\nHerat, they pass an Afghan refugee camp. To Laila, it is a blur of yellow dust and black \\ntents and scanty structures made of corrugated steel sheets. She reaches across the seat and \\ntakes Tariq\\'s hand.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  In Herat, most of the streets are paved, lined with fragrant pines. There are municipal \\nparks and libraries in reconstruction, manicured courtyards, freshly painted buildings. The \\ntraffi c lights work, and, most surprisingly to Laila, electricity is steady. Laila has heard that \\nHerat\\'s feudal style warlord, Ismail Khan, has helped rebuild the city with the considerable \\ncustoms revenue that he collects at the Afghan Iranian border, money th at Kabul says \\nbelongs not to him but to the central government. There is both a reverential and fearful \\ntone when the taxi driver who takes them to Muwaffaq Hotel mentions Ismail Khan\\'s name.  \\n \\n  The two night stay at the Muwaffaq will cost them nearly a fi fth of their savings, but the \\ntrip from Mashad has been long and wearying, and the children are exhausted. The elderly \\nclerk at the desk tells Tariq, as he fetches the room key, that the Muwaffaq is popular with \\njournalists and NGO workers.  \\n \\n  \"Bin Laden s lept here once,\" he boasts.  \\n \\n  The room has two beds, and a bathroom with running cold water. There is a painting of \\nthe poet Khaja Abdullah Ansary on the wall between the beds. From the window, Laila has \\na view of the busy street below, and of a park acro ss the street with pastel colored brick \\npaths cutting through thick clusters of flowers. The children, who have grown accustomed \\nto television, are disappointed that there isn\\'t one in the room. Soon enough, though, they \\nare asleep. Soon enough, Tariq and Laila too have collapsed. Laila sleeps soundly in Tariq\\'s \\narms, except for once in the middle of the night when she wakes from a dream she cannot \\nremember.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  The next morning, after a breakfast of tea with fresh bread, quince marmalade, and boiled \\neggs, Tariq finds her a taxi.  \\n  \"Are you sure you don\\'t want me to come along?\" Tariq says. Aziza is holding his hand \\nZalmai isn\\'t, but he is standing close to Tariq, leaning one shoulder on Tariq\\'s hip.  \\n \\n  \"I\\'m sure.\"  '),\n",

It\\'s of a young girl with pink cheeks and hair \\nparted down the middle into twin braids.  \\n  Laila tells him that she has been in Pakistan for the last year, that she is returning to Kabul. \\n\"Deh Mazang.\"  \\n \\n  Through the win dshield, she sees coppersmiths welding brass handles to jugs, saddle \\nmakers  laying out cuts of rawhide to dry in the sun.  \\n  \"Have you lived here long, brother?\" she asks.  \\n \\n  \"Oh, my whole life. I was born here. I\\'ve seen everything. You remember the uprisi ng?\" \\n \\n  Laila says she does, but he goes on.  \\n \\n  \"This was back in March 1979, about nine months before the Soviets invaded. Some \\nangry Heratis killed a few Soviet advisers, so the Soviets sent in tanks and helicopters and \\npounded this place. For three days , hamshira,  they fired on the city. They collapsed \\nbuildings, destroyed one of the minarets, killed thousands of people.  Thousands.  I lost two \\nsisters in those three days. One of them was twelve years old.\" He taps the photo on his \\nwindshield. \"That\\'s her. \" \\n \\n  \"I\\'m sorry,\" Laila says, marveling at how every Afghan story is marked by death and loss \\nand unimaginable grief. And yet, she sees, people find a way to survive, to go on.

Th e wind \\nmakes the tall grass slam against Laila\\'s calves as she and Hamza climb the path, take the \\nturns. On either side of them is a kaleidoscope of wilciflowers swaying in the wind, some \\ntall with curved petals, others low, fan leafed. Here and there a fe w ragged buttercups peep \\nthrough the low bushes. Laila hears the twitter of swallows overhead and the busy chatter \\nof grasshoppers underfoot.  \\n  They walk uphill this way for two hundred yards or more. Then the path levels, and opens \\ninto a flatter patch of  land. They stop, catch their breath. Laila dabs at her brow with her \\nsleeve and bats at a swarm of mosquitoes hovering in front of her face. Here she sees the \\nlow slung mountains in the horizon, a few cottonwoods, some poplars, various wild bushes \\nthat sh e cannot name.  \\n \\n  \"There used to be a stream here,\" Hamza says, a little out of breath. \"But it\\'s long dried up \\nnow.\"  \\n \\n  He says he will wait here. He tells her to cross the dry streambed, walk toward the \\nmountains.  \\n \\n  \"I\\'ll wait here,\" he says, sitting on  a rock beneath a poplar. \"You go on.\"  \\n \\n  \"I won\\'t \"  \\n \\n  \"Don\\'t worry.

The rest, she imagines, have been ripped up for burning as firewood. The floor \\nis carpeted now with dry edged leaves, broken bottles, discarded chewing gum wrappers, \\nwild mushrooms, old yellowed cigarett e butts. But mostly with weeds, some stunted, some \\nspringing impudently halfway up the walls.  \\n \\n  Fifteen years, Laila thinks. Fifteen years in this place.  \\n  Laila sits down, her back to the wall. She listens to the wind filtering through the willows. \\nThere  are more spider webs  stretched across the ceiling. Someone has spray painted \\nsomething on one of the walls, but much of it has sloughed off, and Laila cannot decipher \\nwhat it says. Then she realizes the letters are Russian. There is a deserted bird's nest  in one \\ncorner and a bat hanging upside down in another corner, where the wall meets the low \\nceiling.  \\n  Laila closes her eyes and sits there awhile.  \\n  In Pakistan, it was difficult sometimes to remember the details of Mariam's face. There \\nwere times when, like a word on the tip of her tongue, Mariam's face eluded her. But now, \\nhere in this place, it's easy to summon Mariam behind the lids of her eyes: the soft radiance \\nof her gaze, the long chin, the coarsened skin of her neck, the tight lipped smile. Here,  Laila \\ncan lay her cheek on the softness of Mariam's lap again, can feel Mariam swaying back and \\nforth, reciting verses from the Koran, can feel the words vibrating down Mariam's body, to \\nher knees, and into her own ears.  \\n \\n  Then, suddenly, the weeds begin  to recede, as if something is pulling them by the roots \\nfrom beneath the ground. They sink lower and lower until the earth in the kolba  has \\nswallowed the last of their spiny leaves. The spider webs  magically unpin  themselves. The \\nbird's nest self disassem bles, the twigs snapping loose one by one, flying out of the kolba  \\nend over end. An invisible eraser wipes the Russian graffiti off the wall.  \\n \\n  The floorboards are back. Laila sees a pair of sleeping cots now, a wooden table, two \\nchairs, a cast iron stove  in the corner, shelves along the walls, on which sit clay pots and \\npans, a blackened teakettle, cups and spoons. She hears chickens clucking outside, the \\ndistant gurgling of the stream.  \\n \\n  A young Mariam is sitting at the table making a doll by the glow o f an oil lamp. She's \\nhumming something. Her face is smooth and youthful, her hair washed, combed back. She \\nhas all her teeth.  \\n  Laila watches Mariam glue strands of yam onto her doll's head. In a few years, this little \\ngirl will be a woman who will make sm all demands on life, who will never burden others, \\nwho will never let on that she too has had sorrows, disappointments, dreams that have been \\nridiculed. A woman who will be like a rock in a riverbed, enduring without complaint, her \\ngrace not sullied but  shaped  by the turbulence that washes over her. Already Laila sees \\nsomething behind this young girl's eyes, something deep in her core, that neither Rasheed \\nnor the Taliban will be able to break. Something as hard and unyielding as a block of \\nlimestone. Somet hing that, in the end, will be  her undoing and Laila's salvation.  \\n \\n  The little girl looks up. Puts down the doll.

She steps out of \\nthe kolba  Outside, the light has shifted slightly. A  wind is blowing, making the grass ripple \\nand the willow branches click.  \\n \\n  Before she leaves the clearing, Laila takes one last look at the kolba  where Mariam had \\nslept, eaten, dreamed, held her breath for Jalil. On sagging walls, the willows cast crooked  \\npatterns that shift with each gust of wind. A crow has landed on the flat roof. It pecks at \\nsomething, squawks, flies off.  \\n \\n  \"Good bye, Mariam.\"  \\n \\n  And, with that, unaware that she is weeping, Laila begins to run through the grass.  \\n  She finds Hamza stil l sitting on the rock. When he spots her, he stands up.  \\n  \"Let\\'s go back,\" he says. Then, \"I have something to give you.\"  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Laila watts for Hamza in the garden by the front door.

He is carrying a box.  \\n \\n  He gives it to Laila.  \\n  \"Jalil Khan gave this to my father a month or so before he died/\\' Hamza says. \"He asked \\nmy father to safeguard it for Mariam until she came to claim it. My father kept it for two \\nyears. Then, just before he passed away, he gave it to me, and asked me to sa ve it for \\nMariam.

But then there is music, and images begin to play on the \\nscreen.  \\n \\n  Laila frowns. She keeps watching for a minute or two. Then she pushes stop, fast forwards \\nthe tape, and pushes play again.

Bui you would not see me. I  \\nwas disappointed but could not blame you. In your place, I  might have done the same. I  lost \\nthe privilege of your  good graces a long time ago and for that I only have myself to blame. \\nBui if you are reading this letter, then you have read the letter that I  left at your door. You \\nhave read it and you have come to see Mullah Faizullah, as I had asked that you do. I  am \\ngrateful that you did, Mariam jo. I  am grateful for this chance to say a few words to you.  \\n  Where do I begin?  \\n \\n  Your father has known so much sorrow since we last spoke, Mariam  jo. Your stepmother \\nAfsoon was killed on the first day of the 1979 uprising. A stray bullet killed your sister \\nNiloufar that same day. I  can still see her, my Utile Niloufar, doing heads tands to impress \\nguests. Your brother Farhad joined the jihad in J 980. The Soviets killed him in J 982, just \\noutside of  Helmand. I n ever got to se e his body. I don 't know if you have children of your \\nown, Mariam  jo, but if you do I pray that God look after them and spare you the grief that I  \\nhave known. I still dream of them. I still dream of my dead children.  \\n  I have dreams of you too, Mariam jo. I miss you. I  miss the sound of your voice, your \\nlaughter. I miss reading to you, and all those times we fished together. Do you remember \\nall those times we fished together? You were a good daughter, Mariam jo, and I cannot \\never think of you without feelin g shame and regret. Regret… When it comes to you, Mariam  \\njo, I have oceans of it. I regret that I did not see you the day you came to Herat. I regret \\nthat I did not open the door and take you in. I regret that I did  not make you a daughter to \\nme, that I let you live in that place for all those years. And  for what? Fear of losing face? \\nOf staining my so called good name? How Utile those things matter to me now after all the \\nloss, all the terrible things I  have seen in this cursed war. Bui now, of course, it is too late. \\nPerhaps this is just punishment for those who have been heartless, to understand only when \\nnothing can be undone. Now all I  can do is say that you were a good daughter, Mariam  jo, \\nand that I  never deserved you. Now all I can do is ask for your  forgiveness. So forgive me, \\nMariam  jo. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me.  \\n \\n  I am not the wealthy man you once knew. The communists confiscated so much of my land, \\nand all of my stores as well. But it is petty to complain, for God for reasons that I do n ot \\nunderstand  has still blessed me with far more than most people. Since my return from \\nKabul, I  have managed to sell what Utile remained of my land. I have enclosed for you \\nyour share of the inheritance. You can see that it is far from a  fortune, but it i s something. \\nIt is something. (You will also notice that I have taken the liberty of exchanging the money \\ninto dollars. I think it is for the best God alone knows the fate of our own beleaguered \\ncurrency.)  \\n  I hope you do not think that I am trying to buy your forgiveness. I hope you will credit me \\nwith knowing that your forgiveness is not for sale. It never was. I am merely giving you, if \\nbelatedly, what was rightfully yours all along. I was not a dutiful father to you in life. \\nPerhaps in death I can be.  \\n  Ah, death. I won't burden you with details, but death is within sight for me now. Weak \\nheart, the doctors say. It is a fitting manner of death, I think, for a weak man.  \"),\n",

That you might find it in your heart to come and see your \\nfather. That you will knock on my door one more time and give me the chance to open it \\nthis time, to welcome you, to take you in my arms, my daught er, as I should have all those \\nyears ago. It is a hope as weak as my heart. This I know. But I will be waiting. I will be \\nlistening for your knock I will be hoping.  \\n  May God grant you a long and prosperous life, my daughter.

It snowed at last this past winter, knee -deep, and now it has been \\nraining for days.  The Kabul River is flowing once again. Its spring floods have washed \\naway Titanic City.  \\n \\n  There is mud on the streets now. Shoes squish. Cars get trapped. Donkeys loaded with \\napples slog heavily, their hooves spla ttering muck from rain puddles. But no one is \\ncomplaining about the mud, no one is mourning Titanic City.  We need Kabul to be green \\nagain,  people say.  \\n \\n  Yesterday, Laila watched her children play in the downpour, hopping from one puddle to \\nanother in thei r backyard beneath a lead colored sky. She was watching from the kitchen \\nwindow of the small two bedroom house that they are renting in Deh Mazang. There is a \\npomegranate tree in the yard and a thicket of sweetbriar bushes. Tariq has patched the walls \\nand built the children a slide, a swing set, a little fenced area for Zalmai\\'s new goat. Laila \\nwatched the rain slide off Zalmai\\'s scalp he has asked that he be shaved, like Tariq, who is \\nin charge now of saying the  Babaloo  prayers. The rain flattened Aziza\\'s long hair, turned it \\ninto sodden tendrils that sprayed Zalmai when she snapped her head.  \\n \\n  Zalmai is almost six. Aziza is ten. They celebrated her birthday last week, took her to \\nCinema Park, where, at last,  Titanic  was openly screened for the people of K abul.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  \"Come on, children, we\\'re going to be late,\" Laila calls, putting their lunches in a paper \\nbag It\\'s eight o\\'clock in the morning. Laila was up at five. As always, it was Aziza who \\nshook her awake for morning  namaz.  The prayers, Laila knows,  are Aziza\\'s way of clinging \\nto Mariam, her way of keeping Mariam close awhile yet before time has its way, before it \\nsnatches Mariam from the garden of her memory like a weed pulled by its roots.  \\n \\n  After  namaz,  Laila had gone back to bed, and was still a sleep when Tariq left the house. \\nShe vaguely remembers him kissing her cheek. Tariq has found work with a French NGO \\nthat fits land mine survivors and amputees with prosthetic limbs.  \\n \\n  Zalmai comes chasing Aziza into the kitchen.  \\n \\n  \"You have your noteboo ks, you two? Pencils? Textbooks?\"  \\n \\n  \"Right here,\" Aziza says, lifting her backpack. Again, Laila notices how her stutter is \\nlessening.  \\n \\n  \"Let\\'s go, then.\"  \\n T '),\n",

They step out into the cool \\nmorning. I t isn\\'t raining today. The sky is blue, and Laila sees no clumps of clouds in the \\nhorizon. Holding hands, the three of them make their way to the bus stop. The streets are \\nbusy already, teeming with a steady stream of rickshaws, taxicabs, UN trucks, buses,  ISAF \\njeeps. Sleepy eyed merchants are unlocking store gates that had been rolled down for the \\nnight Vendors sit behind towers of chewing gum and cigarette packs. Already the widows \\nhave claimed their spots at street corners, asking the passersby for coins . \\n  Laila finds it strange to be back in Kabul The city has changed Every day now she sees \\npeople planting saplings, painting old houses, carrying bricks for new ones. They dig \\ngutters and wells. On windowsills, Laila spots flowers potted in the empty shel ls of old \\nMujahideen rockets rocket flowers, Kabulis call them. Recently, Tariq took Laila and the \\nchildren to the Gardens of Babur, which are being renovated. For the first time in years, \\nLaila hears music at Kabul\\'s street corners,  rubab  and tabla,  dooia r, harmonium and \\ntamboura, old Ahmad Zahir songs.  \\n \\n  Laila wishes Mammy and Babi were alive to see these changes. But, like Mil\\'s letter, \\nKabul\\'s penance has arrived too late.  \\n \\n  Laila and the children are about to cross the street to the bus stop when sud denly a black \\nLand Cruiser with tinted windows blows by. It swerves at the last instant and misses Laila \\nby less than an arm\\'s length. It splatters tea colored rainwater all over the children\\'s shirts.  \\n \\n  Laila yanks her children back onto the sidewalk, he art somersaulting in her throat.  \\n  The Land Cruiser speeds down the street, honks twice, and makes a sharp left.  \\n  Laila stands there, trying to catch her breath, her fingers gripped tightly around her \\nchildren\\'s wrists.  \\n \\n  It slays Laila. It slays her tha t the warlords have been allowed back to Kabul That her \\nparents\\' murderers live in posh homes with walled gardens, that they have been appointed \\nminister of this and deputy minister of that, that they ride with impunity in shiny, \\nbulletproof SUVs through n eighborhoods that they demolished. It slays her.  \\n \\n  But Laila has decided that she will not be crippled by resentment. Mariam wouldn\\'t want \\nit that way.  What\\'s the sense?  she would say with a smile both innocent and wise.  What \\ngood is it, Laila jo?  And so Laila has resigned herself to moving on. For her own sake, for \\nTariq\\'s, for her children\\'s. And for Mariam, who still visits Laila in her dreams, who is \\nnever more than a breath or two below her consciousness. Laila has moved on. Because in \\nthe end she kno ws that\\'s all she can do. That and hope.  \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\n  Zamanis standing at the free throw line, his knees bent, bouncing a basketball. He is \\ninstructing a group of boys in matching jerseys sitting in a semicircle on the court. Zaman \\nspots Laila, tucks the ball  under his arm, and waves. He says something to the boys, who \\nthen wave and cry out, \"Salaam, moalim sahib!\"  \\n  Laila waves back.  '),\n",

There is a \\nnew swing set, new monkey bars, and a jungle gym.  \\n  Laila walks back inside through the screen door.  \\n \\n  They have repainted both the exterior and the interior of the orphanage. Tariq and Zaman \\nhave rep aired all the roof leaks, patched the walls, replaced the windows, carpeted the \\nrooms where the children sleep and play. This past winter, Laila bought a few beds for the \\nchildren's sleeping quarters, pillows too, and proper wool blankets. She had cast iro n stoves \\ninstalled for the winter.  \\n \\n  Anis,  one of Kabul's newspapers, had run a story the month before on the renovation of \\nthe orphanage. They'd taken a photo too, of Zaman, Tariq, Laila, and one of the attendants, \\nstanding in a row behind the children. When Laila saw the article, she'd thought of her \\nchildhood friends Giti and Hasina, and Hasina saying,  By the time we're twenty, Giti and I, \\nwe'll have pushed out four, five kids each Bui you, Laila, you'll make us two dummies proud. \\nYou 're going to be so mebody. I know one day I'll pick up a newspaper and find your \\npicture on the frontpage.  The photo hadn't made the front page, but there it was \\nnevertheless, as Hasina had predicted.  \\n \\n  Laila takes a turn and makes her way down the same hallway where, two y ears before, she \\nand Mariam had delivered Aziza to Zaman. Laila still remembers how they had to pry \\nAziza's fingers from her wrist. She remembers running down this hallway, holding back a \\nhowl, Mariam calling after her, Aziza screaming with panic. The hall way's walls are \\ncovered now with posters, of dinosaurs, cartoon characters, the Buddhas of Bamiyan, and \\ndisplays of artwork by the orphans. Many of the drawings depict tanks running over huts, \\nmen brandishing AK 47s, refugee camp tents, scenes of jihad.  \\n \\n  Laila turns a corner in the hallway and sees the children now, waiting outside the \\nclassroom. She is greeted by their scarves, their shaved scalps covered by skullcaps, their \\nsmall, lean figures, the beauty of their drabness.  \\n \\n  When the children spot Lai la, they come running. They come running at full tilt. Laila is \\nswarmed. There is a flurry of high pitched greetings, of shrill voices, of patting, clutching, \\ntugging, groping, of jostling with one another to climb into her arms. There are outstretched \\nlittle hands and appeals for attention. Some of them call her  Mother.  Laila does not correct \\nthem.  \\n  It takes Laila some work this morning to calm the children down, to get them to form a \\nproper queue, to usher them into the classroom.  \\n \\n  It was Tariq and Zam an who built the classroom by knocking down the wall between two \\nadjacent rooms. The floor is still badly cracked and has missing tiles.

On it, with a brush, Zaman has written four lines of poetry, his \\nanswer, Laila knows, to those who grumble that the promised aid mone y to Afghanistan \\nisn\\'t coming, that the rebuilding is going too slowly, that there is corruption, that the \\nTaliban are regrouping already and will come back with a vengeance, that the world will \\nforget once again about Afghanistan. The lines are from his f avorite of Hafez\\'s  ghazals:  \\n \\n  Joseph shall return to Canaan, grieve not, Hovels shall turn to rose gardens, grieve not. If \\na flood should arrive, to drown all that\\'s alive, Noah is your guide in the typhoon\\'s eye, \\ngrieve not  \\n \\n  Laila passes beneath the si gn and enters the classroom. The children are taking their seats, \\nflipping notebooks open, chattering  Aziza is talking to a girl in the adjacent row. A paper \\nairplane floats across the room in a high arc. Someone tosses it back.  \\n  \"Open your Farsi books, children,\" Laila says, dropping her own books on her desk.  \\n \\n  To a chorus of flipping pages, Laila makes her way to the curtainless window. Through \\nthe glass, she can see the boys in the playground lining up to practice their free throws. \\nAbove them, over the mountains, the morning sun is rising. It catches the metallic rim of \\nthe basketball hoop, the chain link of the tire swings, the whistle hanging around Zaman\\'s \\nneck, his new, unchipped spectacles. Laila flattens her palms against the warm glass panes. \\nCloses her eyes. She lets the sunlight fall on her cheeks, her eyelids, her brow.  \\n \\n  When they first came back to Kabul, it distressed Laila that she didn\\'t know where the \\nTaliban had buried Mariam. She wished she could visit Mariam\\'s grave, to sit with he r \\nawhile, leave a flower or two. But Laila sees now that it doesn\\'t matter. Mariam is never \\nvery far. She is here, in these walls they\\'ve repainted, in the trees they\\'ve planted, in the \\nblankets that keep the children warm, in these pillows and books and p encils. She is in the \\nchildren\\'s laughter. She is in the verses Aziza recites and in the prayers she mutters when \\nshe bows westward. But, mostly, Mariam is in Laila\\'s own heart, where she shines with the \\nbursting radiance of a thousand suns.  \\n \\n  Someone has  been calling her name, Laila realizes. She turns around, instinctively tilts her \\nhead, lifting her good ear just a tad. It\\'s Aziza.  \\n  \"Mammy? Are you all right?\"  \\n \\n  The room has become quiet. The children are watching her.  \\n \\n  Laila is about to answer when  her breath suddenly catches. Her hands shoot down. They \\npat the spot where, a moment before, she\\'d felt a wave go through her. She waits. But there \\nis no more movement.  \\n \\n  \"Mammy?\"  \\n \\n  \"Yes, my love.\" Laila smiles. \"I\\'m all right. Yes.

War, hunger, anarchy, and oppression forced millions of people like \\nTariq and his family in this tale to abandon their homes and flee Afghanistan to settle in \\nneighboring Pakistan and Iran. At the height of the exodus, as many as eight million \\nAfghans were living abroad as refugees. Today, more than two million Afghan refugees \\nremain in Pakistan.  \\n \\n  Over the past year, I have had the privilege of working as a U.S. envoy for UNHCR, the \\nUN refugee agency, one of the world's foremost humanitarian agencies. UNHCR's mandate \\nis to protect the basic human rights of refugees, provide emergency relief, and  to help \\nrefugees restart their lives in a safe environment. UNHCR provides assistance to more than \\ntwenty million displaced people around the world, not only in Afghanistan but also in \\nplaces such as Colombia, Burundi, the Congo, Chad, and the Datfur regi on of Sudan. \\nWorking with UNHCR to help refugees has been one of the most rewarding and \\nmeaningful experiences of my life.  \\n \\n  To help, or simply to learn more about UNHCR, its work, or the plight of refugees in \\ngeneral, please visit:  www.UNrefugees.org  . \\n \\n  Thank you.  \\n  Khaled Hosseini January 31, 2007  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \"),\n",

The village of Gul Daman is a fictional place as \\nfar as I know. Those who are familiar with the city of Herat will notice that I have taken \\nminor liberties describing the geography around it. Last, the title of this novel comes from a \\npoem composed by Saeb -e-Tabrizi, a seventeenth century Persian poet. Those who know \\nthe original Farsi poem will doubtless note that the English translation of the lin e \\ncontaining the title of this novel is not a literal one. But it is the generally accepted \\ntranslation, by Dr. Josephine Davis, and I found it lovely. I am grateful to her.  \\n \\n  I would like to thank Qayoum Sarwar, Hekmat Sadat, Elyse Hathaway, Rosemary Sta sek, \\nLawrence Quill, and Haleema Jazmin Quill for their assistance and support.  \\n \\n  Very special thanks to my father, Baba, for reading this manuscript, for his feedback, and, \\nas ever, for his love and support. And to my mother, whose selfless, gentle spiri t permeates \\nthis tale. You are my reason, Mother jo. My thanks go to my in laws for their generosity \\nand many kindnesses. To the rest of my wonderful family, I remain indebted and grateful to \\neach and every one of you.  \\n \\n  I wish to thank my agent, Elaine K oster, for always, always believing, Jody Hotchkiss \\n(Onward!), David Grossman, Helen Heller, and the tireless Chandler Crawford. I am \\ngrateful and indebted to every single person at Riverhead Books. In particular, I want to \\nthank Susan Petersen Kennedy and  Geoffrey Kloske for their faith in this story.

Special thanks to my sharp eyed \\ncopy editor, Tony Davis, who miss es \\n \\n  nothing, and, lastly, to my talented editor, Sarah McGrath, for her patience, foresight, and \\nguidance.  \\n \\n  Finally, thank you, Roya.

It must have, because Mariam remembered that she had been \\nrestless and preoccupied that day, the way she was only on Thursdays, the day when Jalil \\nvisited her at the  kolba . To pass the time until the moment that she would see him at last, \\ncrossing the knee -high grass in the clearing and waving, Mariam had climbed a chair and \\ntaken down h er mother\\'s Chinese tea set. The tea set was the sole relic that Mariam\\'s \\nmother, Nana, had of her own mother, who had died when Nana was two. Nana cherished \\neach blue -and-white  porcelain piece, the graceful curve of the pot\\'s spout, the hand -painted \\nfinch es and chrysanthemums, the dragon on the sugar bowl, meant to  ward off evil.  \\n \\n  It was this last piece that slipped from Mariam\\'s fingers, that fell to the wooden floor  \\nboards of the  kolba  and shattered.  \\n \\n  When Nana saw the bowl, her face flushed red and her upper lip shivered, and her eyes, \\nboth the lazy one and the good, settled on Mariam in a flat, unblinking way. Nana looked \\nso mad that Mariam feared  the jinn would enter her mother\\'s body again. But  the jinn didn\\'t \\ncome, not that time. Instead, Nana gr abbed Mariam by the wrists, pulled her close, and, \\nthrough gritted teeth, said, \"You are a clumsy little  harami  This is my reward for \\neverything I\\'ve endured An heirloom -breaking, clumsy little  harami.\"  \\n \\n  At the time, Mariam did not understand. She did no t know what this word  \\nharami --bastard --meant  Nor was she old enough to appreciate the injustice, to see that it is \\nthe creators of the  harami  who are culpable, not the  harami,  whose only sin is being born. \\nMariam  did surmise, by the way Nana said the word,  that it was an ugly, loathsome thing to \\nbe a harami,  like an insect, like the scurrying cockroaches Nana was always cursing and \\nsweeping out of the  kolba.  \\n \\n  Later, when she was older, Mariam did understand. It was the way Nana uttered the word \\nnot so muc h saying it as spitting it at her that made Mariam feel the full sting of it. She \\nunderstood then what Nana meant, that a  harami  was an unwanted thing; that she, Mariam, \\nwas an illegitimate person who would never have legitimate claim to the things other \\npeople had, things such as love, family, home, acceptance.  \\n \\n  Jalil never called Mariam this name. Jalil said she was his little flower. He was fond of \\nsitting her on his lap and telling her stories, like the time he told her that Herat, the city \\nwhere Mari am was bo rn, in 1959, had once been the cradle of Persian culture, the home of \\nwriters, painters, and Sufis.  \\n \\n  \"You couldn\\'t stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the ass,\" he laughed.

The novel explores themes of war, violence, and the oppression of women in Afghanistan. Mariam, an illegitimate child, is forced to live in a kolba (a small, makeshift hut) and later ends up in a women\\'s prison. Laila, on the other hand, is a young girl who loses her family and is forced to marry a Taliban soldier. The two women meet and form a bond, finding solace and support in each other.\\n\\nThe novel also highlights the struggles of the Afghan people during the Soviet occupation and the subsequent Taliban regime.
